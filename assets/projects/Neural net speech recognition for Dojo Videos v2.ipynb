      " Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of Dojo Live this Tuesday December 6th, 2022. My name is Kim Lantis and it's my pleasure to be co-hosting along with America girl. Hello, it's been one week I think. I know, last week was a bit of a slow week on Dojo Live, it happens. But you know what, we're going to kick it off, we're going to reignite the energy here with SLOV. SLOV, it's so nice to meet you today and thank you for joining us on Dojo Live. Yeah, thanks for heading me. Yes, SLOV, Zulu, Zulu, Zulu Dev. I hope I got that all right. You were the co-host. Yeah, good. Yes. The co-founder and CTO at SOM, so joining us all the way from Germany today, what time is it for you? It's 7 p.m right now. Not too late. Just in time to wrap up your day. Thank you so much for that. We're definitely looking forward to today's show because it's timely. It's all about what's happening in this new year coming up 2023 and something that's pretty important to almost every single tech company out there and that is verification. But before we get into the trends and opportunities and challenges that are coming up in 2023, we would like to get to know you a bit better. SLOV, if you could please tell us just a bit about your personal story, your passion, and what sort of led up to your time with SOM, so thank you. Yeah, sure. So I guess I will start with like 15 years back when I just moved to Germany to pursue my PhD in computer science and for years later I was deciding what to do next, because I kind of love the freedom of research. At the same time, I saw lots of problems in this area. At the same time, I was always a hands-on guy, so I really liked programming, so I was thinking about industry. So luckily I found the golden middle, so to say, so I found a company which was called Research Gate, based in Berlin, it's a social network for scientists. And for me, it was a perfect opportunity to contribute to science and at the same time being hands-on and code and be in the industry. And I think I was one of the first engineers there and during like seven years, like six-seven years, I've been there and grew to 250 people, so for me it was nice opportunity to observe how a small company transforms into something bigger, how chaotic processes were, essence of them actually go into something really meaningful and more organized. And also I learned lots of in the tech field and big data and machine learning, because it was not my first job, but however, that was the most, let's say, fruitful one for me in terms of skills. But at the same time, I connected with the co-founders of Samsung, they were like friends of mine, right, and they were building actually back in the day the anti-photoshoops of where. So basically figuring out where the image was, tampered or not, where the editing part, pieces of image were, right. So I was kind of consulting them, but then one thing started to move more seriously, so to say, I decided that it's probably time to move on from something new, and I joined them. And that's how we started. That's a beautiful story. So that's talked specifically about Samsung. Who are you as a company? What's this problem that you're solving? Okay, so now we're not anti-photoshoops of where it comes to anymore, right? The point that was learning is to something else. Yeah, so now how I call it, just one stop solution for your compliance and anti-photoshoops needs when it comes to user-owned wording and the managing the full user life cycle. We kind of officially started with the KYC owned wording when we were verifying users, but then at some point we realized that it's not enough, and I hope we'll talk about this today as well. I'll just give a simple example. When you, for example, want to open a bank account, you're in Germany. Of course, in some case, you have to go to the office and fill in papers, but they are so-called progressive ones that allow you to do everything online. So you upload your ID document, you upload like yourself, take yourself, you're right, in some cases when things become a bit trickier. If you, for example, citizen outside of your opinion union, you have to provide your proof address that you leave here and things like that, right? But then when the user was on board and account is gotten, it's just the beginning of the story because the user starts to transact, right? Make some transactions. Some of them could be fraud, some of them could not, right? So there is also a challenge to stay compliant, also protect your users from fraud or your business from fraud, right? And that's what we do. So, I mean, there are lots of variables in this equation, but we try to solve this very complex equation. Yeah, I can completely imagine the complexity. You mentioned, you know, if you're from outside of the European Union, and my particular instance, I'm from the United States, however, I live in Mexico. I've been a permanent resident of Mexico. I've been here for almost 20 years. And when it comes to this, and I think we can get into this later, but I can completely relate, because it's absolutely impossible for me now to open a bank account in the United States, because I do not have a physical address in which I reside in the United States. Like, I'm a US citizen. I have my passport. I make an income. I actually need a bank account because they, they're great to access. Yeah, they can't down to trying to cash a life insurance check, which I've yet cashed because it's in dollars. I can't get it cashed in Mexico, and I can't set up a bank account in the United States to get it done. So it's like, what's going on? Yeah. I know you're putting me in the hands. So, yes. So there's obviously the good sides of Koyce, the criticisms of the drawbacks, and coming to your topic of today of why it's no longer sufficient. So I think this is a really good segue. America, what specifically are we talking about? Yes. So then we're going to talk about trans opportunities and challenges of the verification industry in 2023. So the question is, how is the verification industry evolving? And why is it simply Koyce no longer sufficient to protect from fraud? So could you please give us a high level about this? Why did you choose this topic? Because we are seeing tribe transformation in our area right now. I can talk about this a little bit later about the particular examples. And I mean, the business of Koyce and this online user verification is relatively new. And like technologies change, right? And then also the regulations change, also like crypto emerges. And then suddenly governments realize that they need to control more for obvious reasons, right? So therefore it's really challenging. So I thought like we implement this or that thing and like we'll get eaten. No. It gets more and more complicated. I mean, in terms of like products that you're building to challenge just that you are solving. Yeah. And I think I think that's interesting. If we can pull back very quickly, just as we set the stage as to why Koyce is no longer sufficient, what is Koyce in terms of as it stands today and and kind of high level and what needs to be changing? Okay. Koyce stands for Know Your Customer and that's exactly the example with the opening bank account that I provided. Basically you verify your onboard users and then you give access basically to your service. So you decide, okay, I can trust this person. I meet all the regulatory requirements and this user is able to use our service or company service right now. Honestly, Koyce itself was never enough for staying from fraud. But now this challenge is even bigger, I guess, because for example, deepfakes are really emerging right now. Like even like a couple of years ago it was like super hard, I guess, to create a realistic deepfake and you need to be to be an expert in this area and probably have really good rendering machines. And nowadays, like you have your smartphone, your button and yes. Those filters are freaky. Well, exactly. So there are new challenges about deepfakes. But then also the situation in the world is changing and there are lots of sanctions and where sanctions there are also manual rendering. And the frauds respond new and new schemes, how to circumvent sanctions. So for example, a longer money and for example, NFTs is a relatively new thing. So you can, for example, buy an NFT for 600 dollars and then suddenly like a one million after you sell it for one dollar. Right? Suspicious. Right? So you need to control this aspect of let's say post-one-born yourself. Because fraud happens not only during one-boarding, but also during the customer life cycles and life cycle. And there are lots of reasons or let's say techniques on, yeah, techniques how it can be done. It would be let's say hack account, it would be sold account. It would be even social engineering. Right? So you really need some tools that monitor, monitor transactions. We'll use their actions later on and have some means of let's say verification in the middle. For example, you're transiting and suddenly you're, you're transiting and it becomes suspicious. Maybe you need to pass a live news check again and then meaning that making sure that it's the same person sitting in front of the computer that was on board in a while. Right? So and this transaction monitoring is a big thing right now, especially because crypto is emerging as well. And it's a little bit more anonymous, but then with this KYC and the central current exchange, like crypto exchanges, also thanks to KYC, it's not that anonymous. All right? Some people like it some of them not, but this is typically the requirements from governments. And before like when you were when you were talking about this transactional monitoring, before like even like three years, five years ago, there were no proper solutions. So every company was trying to do this themselves. But since it was not the main area of business, they were probably not really like really building indisogently on time for it, at least in most of the cases. Right? Now those tools are emerging. And especially in our case, since we start with KYC, now we have this KYT, there's no your transaction transaction monitoring. I believe our advantage is that we can marry this to things. And for example, utilize signals for finding suspicious transactions that go during on boarding. And then later on, apply some KYC techniques to resolve suspicious transactions. Again, the example of a live news check that that I provided. Right. And the line just gets fascinating, but at the same time, it's not it's not necessarily even proof in the sense like for example, I utilize my husband's Amazon account often because it's his name. He's the one who has the prime. I want to make a purchase. So I log in. He knows I'm logging in. I'm going to use my own credit card or whatever. And it's legit. But obviously I'm not my husband. I'm going to look very different from what he looked like when what he was on board. And so then it's like, you know, oh, these are authorized users or whatever that that might actually look like right? And I can see why you know, just we've talked about this before on our shows like the bad guys are continuously inventing new ways. And so the good guys have to be continuously inventing new ways as well. So let's just talk about that in terms of trends. I understand that you know, you at Sunsub have, you know, done some some some findings some key findings from fraud reports from 2022. And then what does that look like then as we anticipate shifting into 2023? So let's start with 2022 maybe what what have we found? Unfortunately, we didn't find that things are getting better things are getting worse in terms of fraud. And again, the reasons for it is that like, it was a crypt is more prominent. And then people are finding new ways to so-called sanctions. Also, the technologies also evolving meaning that like, for example, making those deepfakes become much easier. Also regulators inventing new regulations and they're probably sometimes even the full KYC is not required, but companies since like now where in the crisis mode kind of lots of companies, right? So they care more about user conversion rather than like, let's say, security. So they are kind of interesting. I'm worrying as many users and sometimes like in under certain circumstances, even providing your document is not necessary. So you can basically verify your phone like enter your first name, last name, data worth. And that's okay until you transact under $1,000. Yeah. So for those three many reasons, I think fraud is emerging, but it's always get a mouse game. Right? So that's okay. I have a question. Do you need to be necessarily a big company to get access to this platform to use it or it could be for a personal use? With Samsung and the sense of like, who's your client? Who are you helping? Is it individuals or is it exactly? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, we have a actually self-sourced mode where you can just go and sign up and register and get access to basic functionality, just simple KYC, meaning ID plus line-ess. But at the same time, you have to be a company, a registered company, and during seven days we ask you to provide certain documents to make sure that your business is legit and then you have almost silly documents and or you have a website or you will have a website that you're in some corporate registers and things like that. So I'm not aware, but no, actually, of course, like when you're dealing with personal data, you kind of just sign up and collect somebody's own ID. So we take these due diligence very, very seriously. And sometimes maybe even choose seriously that's some company. Right? For example, just got registered. They didn't put up their website, but they already want to build something, roll out in one month. Sometimes we kind of log them and then they have to explain that their ID is on the control of everything is clear. Very good. So I mean, and I think that makes sense. So we're focusing obviously on the B2B, the business side. We're seeing that fraud isn't getting better in 2022. But what does this mean for 2023? What should these businesses, you know, users of some sub or like wise, be looking toward what's going to be happening? What are their clients, their users expecting versus what are the regulations that are going to be coming up and how can we deal with that? First of all, I guess the simple thing that I already mentioned. I mean, the simple thing to explain, deepfakes, right? So I mean, there will be a battle between technologies. And therefore, actually, now you see lots of startup emerging that like focusing just on this particular topic. But moving forward, I think the regulators, they also realize that despite of the classical document-based K-WAC, meaning when you need to upload a picture of a document, is not enough. Some countries are super strict. So for example, Germany, where I'm on a located, they require you to call with a real person and then they check and there's a video stream and then they check that the holograms on this document. Of course, it's very bad for business, I think, in terms of conversion. Because I mean, personally, myself, like I went to open and went back in count and I need to have a call as it now and now lately. And you can imagine there's lots of people just go. But these are regulations and the companies registered in Germany and I have no straight way to follow those rules. For other countries that don't have such a requirement with a video call, they also realize that despite the number of K-WAC providers out there, still the fraud is growing. So they are requiring you, for example, to check against some government database, right? So the data are really correct. And sometimes those databases also contain faces of people, right? So that you can compare your live-masch against that face. It doesn't help against the nicely deepfakes, but at least like if the person is real and then they all get a match from the database, you can be much more sure that this person is there. And at the same time, the amount of those databases that you can get access to is also growing. Of course, you need to find some sort of due diligence, but then some government just open up the gates for the company like ours. So therefore it's a new trend, the trend of, let's say, document less or one click verification, which will be as it is or maybe in addition to the classical KYC, that's not a big trend. And at the same time, and probably the last important trend that we're seeing is that the KYC information can be reused maybe in the future. There are lots of legal aspects to it, but I mean sometimes there is a crypto exchange and then there is a own RAM solution that kind of integrates into this crypto exchange, you buy some crypto for Fiat money, you pass KYC, and then you have to pass KYC at this crypto exchange again. Right? Kind of, it feels like the same service for a user, but then they have to pass KYC twice. And in business, kind of also conversion killer, it's frustrating for users, also to part space, so it's basically a drawbacks for everybody. So we're contemplating, like, thinking about the ways how you can legally make sure that the user can own their data and share them on those pieces that I needed for this particular company. So it will be a big thing, maybe also starting next year. I mean, it's already started actually. In the next five years, I think it will be a big thing. Thank you. It's super interesting. I think we can come back to those specifics in just a few minutes, but before we do, we do actually have a live question from a member of our audience. Yes, the name is Margaro Sanchez, and the question is, how many authentic cake methods are recommendable to have in order to be considered as safe? Safe. There are two parts to it. One being compliant, and I mean, if you're not compliant, your business is in danger because the bank and not the bank, the regulator can withdraw your license, right? And this depends on the country, on the nature of business, and there are lots of lots of variables in today. Consider it safe. It's also a tricky question because there is no simple answer to that because it depends also on the, let's say, industry on the country, and there's like risk profile of your users. But lots of companies, when they can, they utilize this IDV identification, ID document plus, plan as check, proof address, sometimes it's near some sort of utility bill, but this is rather for compliance reasons. It's very, very hard actually to process those documents, and this is a conversion killer, unfortunately. But if you want to be like for super, let's say sensitive scenarios, a video call with an operator is required. So for example, your loss access to your bank account, right? And then you have lots of money there. You don't want just realized simple IDV. You probably want some more secure things. So for example, call with an operator is the key here. So depending on the use case, audience, no simple answer. Sorry. No simple answer. Sorry. Like most things in life, right? But let's turn it back real quick to some sub. And this, I heard you mentioned this many, many times. And of course, this is going to be very, very important to any business. And that is the conversion killer, right? To try to strike this balance between great verification that doesn't, of course, hinder the end user who's like, oh, screw this. This is still complicated. I'm not doing this. Or even it, I think, give us the sense of doubts, right? Because I think there's, for me at least personally, there's those two things. Like number one, I'm like, as we say here in Spanish and Mexico, in Mexico, Kifu Kira, right? Like, like, I just, I'm not doing this. Like, I don't feel like it. I'll do it later or whatever. And then the two is, why did they need to know this in this raising of suspicion when it's actually something that's meant to protect you, but it can actually feel like it's achieving the opposite. So how does, I know that's a big intro. But my question is, how does some sub play into this? How is your product, therefore, kind of going through all of these loops to prevent the conversion killing, but still getting the verification? Yeah, there are some things that probably don't depend on us too much because they also depend on the service. So a user needs to have a strong motivation to pass KYC. I mean, if you just want to play some game and then suddenly you ask for a passport, then probably, I mean, there's no goal on only a few people who go for that. And the second thing is actually education. Some people are getting more and more used to those verifications. And even like my friends that are even non-technical, they know what KYC is. That was, which we recently surprised. I'm keep hearing that true there, but if not, what it is, right? So, and it will get better and better. So people will ask us, go ask and ask questions. And then, of course, they will trade convenience for, for what's a anonymity. I mean, it's already started a long time ago, when we will start to use social networks and will be even worse in this respect. But the uploading documents, I think it's not the biggest challenge at least for us, because I mean, we kind of like really affect the motivation of the initial service. But what we can do, we can build, like, one, we're building a service that don't decline users just for nothing, right? And that's the biggest challenge, because I mean, there are a variety of the documents in the world that you can process and sometimes the lightning conditions are not good. And sometimes people are using, like maybe cheap Android phones, right? We're really bad cameras where it's impossible to make good photo, right? And then we can serve. Yeah, so that's what we're guilty. So that's what we're seeing and being able to process those documents, even in all of the countries and all types of documents is very, very crucial. And not only process and extract data from them, but also know all the security features of those documents, like the title form they're using and things like that. Because I mean, when it comes to Europe, for example, it's relatively easy. The documents pretty much look like, right? But when it comes to India, let's say, Brazil on Nigeria, they have like paper-based documents that, for example, are easily damaged. So over time, they're getting damaged and some of them contain black and white pictures photos on them. And it's very easy to glue another picture on top of it. So those documents are not secure at all. But still, you need to be able to process. And of course, you don't want to let in thrusters, but at the same time, you want good users in. So that's the challenge. And since now, businesses are becoming more and more global in nature, especially crypto businesses, right? Because I mean, people are using crypto all over the world, but also banks, and other fintech organizations. They're becoming more and more important to understand, not only European documents, for example, or US driving licenses, but the documents all over the world. And of course, the companies that take the KYC provider, they also don't want to connect to 10 different ones that are good in this particular region, but they just want to have one stop solution. And therefore, I think that's where we shine, because we started with complicated cases. And then it was for us just an easy exercise to say work well with European documents. So that's that's the part where KYC provider is in can shine or actually lose the trust. Yeah, I think that's super smart in terms of your own business approach, right? As you see the examples that you just laid out, like if you can tackle Nigeria, then Europe should be a breeze, right? So it's I think that approach of sort of looking at things a bit backwards, right? And is very, very smart. So you know, we're come up to the final few minutes of our conversation today. And exactly we wanted to kind of what else in terms of some sub different sheets you as a company. And I think specifically with your company culture, what as a co-founder, you know, what have you learned and what are you, what are you establishing as a team that maybe other companies and leaders might want to emulate? Before you answer that, can we relate this question, but with the why your logo is a wool dog with pixels or is it different? Is that what I'm thinking? I said ball luck with pixels, right? Initially it was from Sherlock Holmes and Sherlock Holmes. It's dog, right? And then we made it more like pixelated to kind of stress out that we're in the digital world. And that's how it was. Yeah, I love it. The investigation, right? The KYC, but this looks like on a global scale Nigeria versus Germany. She was like the very big streams and everything in between. The perfect. I love the origin story of the Sherlock Holmes connection. I think it's beautiful. What are you creating? What is the culture like at some sub? Yeah, when we talk about the company culture, I mean, it's very hard to define. I mean, everybody is talking about it and of course everybody is dreaming about being open and like communicate honestly and all this stuff. And I believe we do have this, but I just probably want to emphasize a couple of things that maybe not every company has, right? So in our company, everybody can become the one who, you know, she wants to become and I may give you a couple of examples like I think three or four years ago, I have I hired a very junior tech support engineer engineer, right? So he was responsible for answering questions with the clients, maybe just, you know, reading the documentation and answering them. Now he's ahead over, you know, the whole internal development team at Samsung and he's managing team of 15 people and he knows the product, one of the best. Now company and can also go to the client's call and maybe sell or maybe explain better. So that's one example, another example we had a girl who was annotating data for machine learning algorithms and now she's in the quality assurance department and not only testing by hands, but also um, um, development skills in the automation, the automated QA, right? So this is just a couple of examples of how people that like they were in one position, but they like went pretty far. And I think it's very important and I think the key to that is actually give people responsibility. And that's actually why I didn't want to hire college assurance engineers at first because I didn't want developers to relax and rely on QA people, right? So they were like relying on their own like development and the peer, peer reviews for their colleagues. At some point I surrendered, so I would have a QA department, but nonetheless, like I believe that giving responsibility to people is a key thing there and also like I'm sure for people that also want to have fun at work. I know that not everybody is like that and some people have strict separation between personal life and working, that's great, that's okay, right? But I would, but my belief is that since we're spending most of the time at work at this normal people, right, it's very important to have fun at work. And if you don't have fun at work, then I mean, just not about us. Yeah, I guess. What are you doing there, Ben? Yeah, I love it. Is there any particular way in which some sub is sort of facilitating that ability to learn and grow as an individual? I mean, I think a lot of it comes from our own initiative, right, and desire. But what sort of have you done to help make that type of growth accessible? I guess sometimes you're giving this responsibility and even more than person is able to cope at the moment, but then I'm just observing how this person coats with this. And there are like many, many people working at some sub. I see that they want to develop themselves and therefore they push it forward and they actually like when I push them forward, when I give them something that they have no clue how to solve, but they learn to figure out how to solve this, right? And I think it also comes from myself when I believe that at some point, you need your team's success as your success. So you should let it go and be happy when people that are surrounding you are better at things that you were very good at before, but now they even better and you are not jealous, but rather very, very happy. And when it comes, then I think people see it and then they want to come to you and learn. And it's kind of, you know, was a chicken and egg problem and the self healing process, I would say, not self healing, but how you call it. But you got my point. Yeah, it's like a self growth or reproductive. I get here and I'm not doing that. I'm not doing any better trying to figure it out either. But what I am hearing is this idea of setting up challenges in a safe space, right? Like I'm presenting you with a challenge, but I think what you're done is successfully remove the fear of failure. What doesn't mean that failure isn't going to happen. It's just like, it's okay. It's part of the challenge. And I think that's a really beautiful environment to be working in. Thank you. Perfect. Well, thank you so much to Slough for your time today for presenting some sub to us and what's in future for KYC. Well, we cannot expect and the challenges presented for 2023 to keep that in mind. And it's awesome that there are providers like yourselves who help sort of take that overwhelming nest, right, away from others. So they can focus on their core capacity, right? The core idea of what their core business, exactly. Thank you. Thank you so much. And especially that this is the end of your day. Your evening was a pleasure to spend it. Yeah, it was pleasure to be here. Thank you very much. Thank you. Perfect. Stick around for just a minute as we go off air. But before we do, we'd like to share what we've got coming up on Thursday. Yay. On Thursday, we are going to have a conversation with Montana Bouch, founder and CEO at the company Spativity. The topic is going to be about Spature activity, develop your passion, achieve your goals. How does data and create thinking super power team decision making? Yeah, all about teams. Gen Z were right up. Yeah. All right. Perfect. Thank you, Genslough. Have a great rest of your day. Everyone and we'll see you Thursday, 10 o'clock, Pacific. Bye for now. Thanks.\n"

Because I mean, personally, myself, like I went to open and went back in count and I need to have a call as it now and now lately. And you can imagine there's lots of people just go.

Right? Kind of, it feels like the same service for a user, but then they have to pass KYC twice. And in business, kind of also conversion killer, it's frustrating for users, also to part space, so it's basically a drawbacks for everybody. So we're contemplating, like, thinking about the ways how you can legally make sure that the user can own their data and share them on those pieces that I needed for this particular company.

It's very, very hard actually to process those documents, and this is a conversion killer, unfortunately.

How is your product, therefore, kind of going through all of these loops to prevent the conversion killing, but still getting the verification? Yeah, there are some things that probably don't depend on us too much because they also depend on the service. So a user needs to have a strong motivation to pass KYC.

      " Hello everyone and welcome to the final Dojo live show of the week this Thursday November 17th 2022. My name is Ken Lentus and it's my pleasure to be hosting along today with Jorge Hernandez. Jorge, thank you so much for joining me today. Thank you for inviting me to come. It's so much fun to be here. Thank you. It's going to be a fun one and of course the guest of today's show, the most important person joining us today is Joseph Schneier, who is the CEO and co-founder of trusty care. Joseph, thank you so much for spending your time with us today and of course sharing your knowledge with us today. I'm so glad to be here. Yeah, so it's going to be a great conversation. I'm a bit jealous. Joseph is in Las Vegas so he's throughout good food and all that jazz but he's already going to home, I guess. You go to you frequent Vegas too often with work I hear. Well, just enough. All right, so those of you who are wondering what are we going to be talking about today? We're going to be talking about these surprising things. Joseph and trusty care have learned about how healthcare works. Something that is incredibly relevant, I think, to all of us. But before we get there, we really would like to get to know you a bit better. Joseph, if you could share a bit about your personal story, your passions and what's kind of led up to trusty care, thank you. Sure, yeah, great. So glad to be here. I've been running trusty care for four years but I've been running technology companies since 2003. So for a very long time, just about 20 years. And I got into this line of business of working in the healthcare space in a little bit of a roundabout pathway. I have been running companies in the educational technology sector. We were building out products that were helping people who didn't believe that they could learn something to realize that they could actually learn that subject and incorporate that learning into their life. So just a few quick examples where things like how do you convince an American that they can learn a foreign language and learn that language, which is. That's so boring. Yeah, it was interesting. A lot of people feel like it's not possible, but people over the world learn foreign languages. And so about, let's see, in 2006 or so, some behavioral research scientists came to me and said, you know, you're doing all this work in education. I wonder if we couldn't apply some of what you're doing to patient behavioral change, which I didn't really have any experience in the healthcare sector at the time. But I said, why not? Let's give it a shot. And so we started testing out things like how do you take a population that's maybe a complex population and that is, you know, maybe not being adherent with their medications or we worked with youth who were being honest with their doctors about how much alcohol they consumed, and a variety of different subjects and how do you get them to change that behavior in a way that was going to benefit their health. So I sort of dropped in the deep end of the healthcare pool at the time. And then I started trusting care after having spent all this time in healthcare. And then I had a personal event happen that really was the impetus to get this company going. My younger brother, who's just a year younger than me, got into a car accident, a pretty severe car accident. And I got a call, you know, at night I flew in the next morning. And he had written into a brick wall at 50 miles per hour. So it was really intense. And I'm sitting in the ICU with him and the surgeon comes into the room and he was like, we're going to have to figure out how to get your brother out of the hospital because he doesn't have any health insurance. And that was what I was first of all, I was like, this is not your job, like what are you doing? You're the surgeon. So but secondly, like I'm an I was an empowered person who like understood how the healthcare system worked to some extent at the time. I could be pretty pushy. And it was still incredibly difficult to figure out how to get his healthcare covered, get him on some kind of insurance, make sure that it didn't bankrupt our entire family. And so that was why we started trusty care. I realized that there was so much complexity in the system. And that my brother had me and some of my family at the table helping him. But most families don't have that. They're in that situation. They don't understand how healthcare works. They don't have somebody who's advocating for them. So that's how we, that's why we got the company started. Wow. Well, thank you so much for sharing that very powerful personal story. And you're right. I think a most individual is in a situation like your and your families would be as we say, a crap creek without a paddle, right? And I think how cool of you to be able to take that experience and shift it and be like, Hey, this is a reality. We got lucky. But most people don't let's see, let's see what we can do about it. So tell me exactly what trusty care is doing and what we have an idea now of the problem that you're solving. But how, how are you going about solving it? Yeah. So this sort of leads into why I wanted to talk a little bit about this topic of the surprising things about healthcare. So we started the company initially thinking we were going to create a platform for consumers to help them to understand how to pick the right health insurance product. And we jumped in sort of thinking like we'd be able to solve that really quickly. We put up a website online on my co-founder and I that was helping to distill different types of health insurance. And in a week, the government in New York City shut our website down and said, you can't do this. And it was our, it was this first moment of being like, well, this is going to be a lot more complex than when we realized. And that got us into what we ended up actually doing. So what we realized was it's difficult for consumers to pick the right health insurance product and to navigate health insurance. And I think most of us think that's because intentionally health insurance are making it complex. And what we found as we got into this industry was actually, it's it's complex for almost everybody in the industry themselves too. And there's just a lot of messiness of systems that the health insurers are working with that end up at the end of the day hurting consumers, but are also difficult for the health insurance themselves. So we built out a platform that we sell to a health insurer and it helps them to get in the right type of member that is a good fit for their plan so that they can actually cover them properly. And and then we provide the member with tools to understand how to use their plan correctly in ways that can help them to save money and get better access to health care. So but our customers ended up being the health insurer in the end. Which is kind of ironic, right? I think I think it makes a lot of sense though because it makes perfect sense at least even just from a business standpoint because you've got the the the provider who's actually the one who's interested. I think this is their bread and butter and if you can make it easier for them, then the the the consequence of that is that the people who can then benefit, right? It's sort of like the tender of health insurance. There's this this matching right like hey this is what we offer hey you fit like yeah I love it I love it so yeah I'm sorry yeah so before we think all this complexity comes from because from the sounds of it it's like totally unintentional and even people who have been to spend their entire lives working on this are like okay this is really like we're in the weeds so yeah before you think that that comes from how they do how they would get here yeah well I think it's a bit of a like a misnomer when we say health care or the health care system because the health care system is hundreds and hundreds of systems that work together and so part of the complexity is that we we talk about this as if it's one thing when it's lots of things that need to work together in a coordinated fashion and health care is complicated in a lot of places I think most Americans tend to think that overseas everything is super simple everything's free and wonderful and perfect and only America is at a problem but actually in most countries you're going to have some some challenges related to health care because health care is complex it's expensive it's involves lots of different constituents and how we got here in America is kind of an interesting story but I think the main thing to note is just health care itself is is where like people's fears and challenges are meeting up with systems and that's that can be difficult to navigate so and in in the US it's interesting we sort of took a different pathway than a lot of other countries and how people think about health care in the US as they usually think about like I have an employer I get my health insurance through them and that's how health care works in America and there's been a lot of talk of like we need to change all of that but I think one of the things that's been the most surprising about the work we do is that we realize that about 150 million Americans get their health care and health insurance in almost the same way as most of the world's publicly funded either through Medicare or Medicaid some kind of like marketplace type of plan and these the way that health part of the health care system works in the US is actually very similar to lots of other countries so there's another really surprising thing is that there's like a lot of people in America they get health care in a similar way to other countries it still is complex for them but it's more similar than different so yeah is are those 150 million I mean presumably this is mostly older individuals in the United States is that your focus at trusty care like and how does this work in that in that sense yeah so yeah just maybe take a step back sort of definition like there are three main categories of people who get health care that is I guess four that is associated with the government so you have older adults 10,000 new people who are getting health care as an older adult every single day so it's a lot of people you have lower income people who are getting their insurance through like a Medicaid you have people who are self-employed or work to small business and they get their insurance through like Obamacare sort of marketplace type of plan and then obviously people who are in the military or defense who are getting their insurance through the government as well so the together this makes up a large percentage of people in the US of citizens of the US yeah thank you and so how does your platform work I know this is geared toward the provider itself and then ultimately the the patient or the insured is the one who's benefiting but what does the dynamic look like what is it exactly that a provider can expect and what's this what's the matching yeah so let's say you're turning 65 and you need to get health insurance through Medicare so that's the portion that's for older adults and that is still our primary focus although we we work with these other populations as well so you know if you were Kim turning 65 I'm sure you would wake up one day and you'd think like okay now what you know you wouldn't suddenly magically understand how to get Medicare or even know that it's Medicare or Medicaid it all sounds very confusing to people so what normally happens is people go online they start searching around they get confused and they end up with some kind of broker that helps them to figure out what type of health insurance to get and about 80% of people who are purchasing health insurance are getting it through a broker and that broker could be somebody who works for a health insurance company or they work independently so there's different different ways so our platform we sell both to health insurance brokers and directly to a health insurance company and it's used by those sales agents as brokers like kind of a CRM your right kind of like tender like a matching system to connect the right help that broker to connect an individual with the right health insurance product so they live in breathe in it like sales force they're using it for their day-to-day business and then that the platform does lots of different things to also help the sales process but the primary interaction the consumer has is with this broker and then we're sort of sitting in the background assisting the system to help that individual so in that sense is it also helping create like a census special specialization like me as a broker like I know I know the ins and outs of this sector of this state of these medical conditions and then you know alternative not only are they better oh what they're doing but then offering that better care to to their their buyer what we called here buyers patients yeah um yeah people call them either their clients or their members but yeah in this in this circumstance um yeah that's what they usually call yeah okay but are they able to then pull in on that specialization and then just do what they're doing better as well yeah so they're able to focus on making sure that like they collect all the right information on the individual and then the system itself is identifying what's important for that individual with the different health insurance products so like and I can make many things that people don't know about so you may think like oh you know I always want to go to Walgreens or CBS because it's on the corner by my house and that's where I always want to go um but it could be with your health conditions that the best health insurance plan for you to get um that pharmacy is not in network for you and so if you kept going to that pharmacy you'd end up spending a lot more money which most people don't know like that when you get insurance you're supposed to go to a specific pharmacy that's associated with your insurance and so it's that kind of thing where we try to take into account what are your preferences like are you gonna not pick up your medications so you should find a health insurance plan that allows you to go to that pharmacy or does it matter more that you get your medications covered in a cost-effective way so you should get this other health insurance plan and go to a different pharmacy so it helps to really personalize um and tease out what's important for you as an individual and helps that broker to do that in an easy way so that they're not spending the in-eternity trying to make that happen cool i actually have a question that's coming back to like the individual side and i think just the overwhelming nature that you mentioned about healthcare in the United States my personal story i think we we shared this a bit uh pre-show and i think i've mentioned it on the show before but my mom actually ended up passing away about a year and a half ago it was a whole strange thing everything we think thank you we think it was related to strokes and whatnot but she did have and i'm not even sure which one it was to be honest Medicare, Medicaid she lived in the state of Arizona when her health started to kind of decline my sister and i my brother we opted for her to go with my sister who's a registered nurse to the state of Wyoming or she could you know be with my sister and and start this discovery process of what's happening and little did we know that my mom's particular policy was more specific to the state of Arizona she wasn't yet covered in in Wyoming and so there had to be this whole shift and change and then of course that ended up taking i don't know several weeks a month which impacted i think the quality of care that she may have been able to receive within within that time frame so as individuals and insurance policy holders like is is trusted care able to help navigate those types of waters or is it the the the broker or who's coming in and saying this will be helpful or is it both who's getting alerted on perhaps these questions that we don't even know to ask right yeah we mostly are empowering the broker to communicate that more clearly to the consumer so so for instance when your mom was purchasing i'm assuming Medicare um so a lot of people don't realize this when when you get Medicare it's not like you're getting it from directly from the government it still is you're getting it um through like an app now or a signal that is managing your insurance on behalf of the government and there's different types of Medicare you can get and there's one kind you can get where you could go to a doctor anywhere in the country so wouldn't have mattered at all they they if you had moved from Arizona to Wyoming your insurance would have just been able to cover everything wherever you are and then there's some types of Medicare that are really like um much more local to where you live and um and it's important to to know you know which kind of you get um and for the broker in that circumstance it would have been good for them to know like this patient has this type of insurance and if they need to move here are the things we're going to need to do in advance here are some ways we could potentially accelerate the process for them when they arrive here are some things we could get started ahead of time um so that they that there wasn't that gap um there probably were things that could have been done um if if your mom had had the right assistance at the time yeah thank you um so let's talk about the empowerment of the brokers themselves then or how would you go about building your network with and trusty care it obviously it seems it's very I can hear and I can sense that it's very important that you're creating a network of people who genuinely care right um so what what does that look like in terms of you building your partners and your who's who's utilizing trusty care it is it is important for us that our customers can do their jobs well um I wish I could say that all of them really care but what they really care a lot about is selling insurance what we care about is making sure that they do that in a way that really benefits the consumer um so we have to always balance like as a business what are the needs of our customer which is like they want to run their business with what are the needs and like what is the mission of the company which is to make sure that these individuals um don't go bankrupt because of their a bad of pocket healthcare costs and so the way that we do that balance is that we've developed the system that makes it really simple and easy for them to make good choices on behalf of their customers um and uh so and building a network um there are um hundreds of thousands of people of brokers that do this work um and we sell to them but then we also sell to health insurers that um and they provide the tool for their internal sales agents as well so it's a combination of selling to like this large group of um individuals out there who are um out there running their small businesses and then also to these large health insurers that they'd also go direct to consumer in their sales thank you thank you um you know we're I think real quick we're going to be touching I think on you again as an individual some of your lessons learned words of wisdom company culture here at trust care before we do for any final questions you might have as it's related to something surprising that that Joseph has learned in his healthcare experience yeah so we touched a little bit on what it's like for seniors but what's it like for the rest of us those who haven't gone into that stage of our lives uh and I'm particularly thinking about groups for the medical community hasn't been always serving them them well uh starting with women like but most people probably don't know but most for seniors and medicine gets tested on men yeah so it's not always what a women need so there is something that you know it's it's failing women but there are other people like the LGBTQ plus community there are other people like as you said who have just you know the foster job who uh don't don't don't have that easy way of navigating the system because they are part of an underserved or minority community so what have you learned about the system that could help those people and how is trust care how does trust care come into that well some of what we can do to help is um also working with the government and moving policy so there's been a big move across the country um from the federal government in a state uh basis to move towards a different way of paying doctors and insurers and the this it it sounds a little lazy but the briefest overview instead of paying a doctor for each time they perform a procedure they're paying them some of money to manage an individual over the course of a year and the reason why this is relevant is now they really need to do well um for each of their patients um woman man doesn't matter if they want to be making having a profit in their business it requires them to actually um serve their patients better which is exciting so this is a move what they call movie towards value-based care um and i think it's going to have a really profound impact over the next um couple decades on the US health care system um there's also been a lot of really exciting things coming out recently of um startups that are focusing specifically on things like um women of color or mortality rates of pregnant women in the US um that are women of color there's and that's that's been exciting to see that venture funds are starting to fund those types of companies um and um i'm i'm really hopeful that that type of work will continue and then specifically um what what we do is we we really make sure to make sure we get the the right profile the individual and understand what really matters to them and what their challenges are so that the information they're getting from us is clear and and easy to understand is not filled with like tons of jargon that you're not going to be able to understand um so and that helps somebody if they're low income if they're a woman if they're LGBTQ it's really just the distillation of like what are the things that are important to you as a patient um and your interactions with the health care system that's really great and i the value-based care concept it seems so obvious but um it's absolutely revolutionary to me right now and embarrassed to to admit that so just let's kind of bring it back to you i think in terms of a a company leader and co-founding uh trusty care some of your lessons learned in terms of what would you maybe counsel other other leaders to do what's worked out well for you maybe something that you've done that hasn't quite worked out well um and we they could learn from you rather than repeating the same mistake i think one of the things that i wish if i could go back in time and tell myself as a younger person is that um there's no amount of competence in an individual that is going to matter more um then like if they are also like toxic to your culture so it's really um important to recognize that just because somebody maybe is the best salesperson or the best coder if they are causing a lot of harm to the culture it's gonna end up costing the company financially in the logren and every time i've made that mistake i have i have regretted it and i wish i would be smart enough to not make it again so um that's one thing is like don't be afraid to stick by the culture that you're building and to build a good place for people where people feel welcome and um and to try to address any kind of toxicity as quickly as possible i i think that's really key um any tips on how you've kind of gone about addressing that maybe for those uh who says yeah uh but that's scary right that's easier said than done what methods or processes have you used in your approach that have worked out well okay i think that the first thing is really communicating the values of the company to everybody from day one so we've tried to create a culture that is um really diverse and we look at diversity across lots of different lines both from like um you know what is what are your religious uh background are are you were you born in the u.s. what's your education level also obviously race class all these different things but we put that out in the interview process to make sure that people are comfortable with that and and and if we see any hesitancy around any of those areas then we know they're probably not gonna work out well and so sort of using your values as the filter to hold yourself accountable to what you're trying to build culture wise so if we see somebody is like just not jiving with the values of the company we're just probably not a good fit for them you know so um yeah and and trusting that you've you've created values for a reason and it's for their benefit as much as for yours um so i love that i'm also curious as we were reading into today's show it actually reminded me of a past guest that we had here on doj-libe dan chapero of uh glow forge and um this came out like one of the things that his company is doing and talking about health insurance is they published their health insurance policy on their careers page it's absolutely transparent it's it's available to anyone who might you know have a create can this condition pre existing condition and wondering am i covered is this gonna help in my career choice perhaps um those who are transgender and going through transitions um women's health care in terms of how they're able to support um uh with you know different types of you know birth control methods or or even travel and abortion and i thought that was really awesome like this level transparency to bring forward at the beginning um like you're saying at the very beginning of this engagement not just for you as a company will do they fit this is a individual foot with us but for the individual do i fit is this gonna be a smart move for me oh what else are what kind of approaches maybe is trusty care taking in that similar way of discovery of transparency what are those key components of your culture yeah um for us a couple of different things so it's really important for us that our company is reflecting um the the what America looks like um so we made a commitment from the very beginning that we weren't going to skew ourselves in like we're only hiring democrats or only hiring people from the coast or like you know anything along those lines but what we've wanted to create is a safe space where no matter where you're coming from if your interest is in improving the u.s health care system um and you're committed to that then you have a place here um and we uh so we have um i over 50 percent female um i employees at least 30 percent are immigrants it's probably a good split between half of the company that went to an i-vehleague school and half the company that has a high school education and and we're really are committed to making that clear to people so then when people show up to to um interview with us when they look across they see themselves there there's there's not they're you're not going to come and be from some background where you're thinking like this is there's no place for me at this company um and i think that's been a key uh piece for us um and building that in from the beginning so startups i think often wait to do that later on they're like well do that address that further down the road and we said what we're gonna is trying to do this from the very beginning and i think it's made a real difference um i think that's awesome and especially in health care because you asked this question of what does america look like and there's so much that goes into that rather than this you know i'd like picture that we're we're supposed to come to our mind and to have this variety and this genuinely diverse group of individuals trying to attack health care you're going to be able to of course cover all facets of health care that maybe you wouldn't even have thought of before in the conversation because someone can step up and say that's not my experience right right and so have you seen that kind of play out in terms of where your vision as a company is headed like in terms of you know stepping out of the united states in timura for like an international sector what have you seen those types of conversations uh yeah yeah no it's given us a really good feel for like you know what is the experience of somebody who is trying to navigate health care if they live in in tenisee or in florida or if they if they're coming here and they need a um a visa to be able to work here how does that affect things um and it really has helped it to give us insight into what are the different possible challenges that our end users which are the consumers could be facing as they navigate the health system um and then internationally we are we've we've built the company to be able to go international and um i we've spent a lot of time looking at where they're comparable um countries that have similar challenges that the u.s. has in in health care navigation and it could be that it's the the navigation is not because it's a cost reason it could be that it's just hard to figure it out or um and uh so we we are not going to bring to go international this year but we definitely anticipate within the next say you know three or four years to be in a couple of other countries that's that's really amazing i think starting at the beginning with the end in mind is is one of those things that you did right right as as a a founder perfect well we are actually at the end i've gotten past a little bit actually if you can believe in on our half hour today Joseph it has been a true pleasure learning from you today thank you for sharing all about trusty care with us Jorge of course thank you for joining me as well wish you all um nothing but success as we move forward um stick around just a minute as we going to go off air but viewers i would like to remind you that on monday we do have our recap show where we will be talking about Joseph's show and the other two shows that we had this week and introducing of course the great shows that we've got coming up for you actually show next week is thanksgiving week as we're all quite aware so we only got one show coming up next week but it's going to be great one so do check it out 10 o'clock Pacific right here um go to light thank you and take care thank you all this is great thank you\n"

      " Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of Dojo Live this Wednesday, November 23rd, 2022. My name is Kim Lantis and it's my pleasure to be hosting along with America Guerrero today. Hello Kim, hello, Sigram. Sigram, right? Yes, Sigram, that's right. Hello, America. Hello, Sigram. We're so happy to have you on the show today. For those of you watching, Sigram is the CEO of Stockably joining us from South Africa. So good evening, Sigram. Yes, good evening. Perfect. You know, so today we're going to be talking about an interesting topic that's, you know, been quite trendy for the last few years and that is blockchain, but specifically how that relates to media copyright. Before we get into the details, however, we would love to get to know you a bit better, Sigram. Your story, your passions, what's led up to Stockably, so please share a bit about yourself with us. Thank you. Thanks, Tim. Well, I've been a creator for probably as long as I can remember. When I left high school, I thought, you know, what I'm going to, I'm going to do something creatively and so I thought, you know, what design, this is, this is it because here I get to make something from nothing. And so I decided I was going to become a designer and I spent about two years doing that and learning all the way. Definitely was one of those like, I didn't study for it at all. I just kind of thought I knew what I was doing. So I convinced someone that I knew what I was doing. And in my own, you did that for about two years. And that's when photography sort of started coming in. And this was something that I, as a kid, I was had dabbled with, but I never sort of realized like this was an actual career option. So that's why I thought design was the creative outlates. Anyway, and so I had a fantastic boss and he gave me an ultimatum and he said, you know, it's a dream you can either quit or I'm going to fire you, but you need to go and do your own thing. And it was kind of like the kick out of the nest that I needed at a tender age of 21. And that was when I decided I was going to try this photography thing that I thought also passionate about. You very quickly learn it is mostly business. And that's where, yeah, you sort of, the back shattered illusion gets broken and you realize it's mostly really about building a business. It's very list about taking photos and so much of it, before you even get to taking the photos part has to do with your business relationships, understanding demands and needs. Because I mean, if no one's going to hire you if they don't ever need for you. So it's sort of like you start learning really, really quickly on the ropes like you just decide on a niche. You can't just be jack-able trades because I mean, you know what, no one's going to hire a guy that says he can take photos of your dog and your wedding because well, what's it going to be? Good dog photo or good wedding photos. And that's kind of like where... Maybe where? If the dog is the best man. What happens? I am totally having my dog as my best man. I have four dogs. So they're going to have to fight for that role. So anyway, but that's sort of when I really sort of decided on me to look at what was what was my passion, where was I really passionate and where did I want to put my efforts? And that sort of, well, being a guy, you know what, I love cars. So I started taking photos of cars. And that kind of sort of like really, really quickly grew because when you're like doing something, you don't mind doing a lot of it. So you just kind of like doing this, but you loving what you're doing and you're learning on the job then. Once again, it's sort of like one of those things where you just the months sort of like go by really quickly. And that sort of just escalated and very soon I had my first magazine shoot, which I was so proud of. It was like... What was it? What was it? What was the car? Well, the car was nothing you had right ever but it was a modified car magazine called Max Power. And the car was... They did have something called a zero day cover where literally they don't have a cover to go to prints up until the day that magazine has to go to the princess. So they have this thing called a zero day cover where you have to come in, shoot something, deliver it on the same day. Which in editorial is a little bit extreme. Anyway, I got thrown into this. They were like, well, so you can see what you do. And I was like, you know, this is my mirror to shine. I dusted myself open and I did the best job I could. And looking back now, it's shocking. But you know what, that was my foray into the big wide world of editorial. And that magazine shut down two months later. Unfortunately, hopefully not because of the cover. But it was... There were there were... I'm nothing to do with that promise. But anyway, that was my foray into editorial. And I spent probably the next decade there and I absolutely loved editorial. It was really my proving brown for myself as a photographer because I really had to be able to produce things from very little. And that sort of transition is quite fluidly, then into commercial photography. And that's what I've been doing ever since. It's been traveling around the world and commercial ad campaigns for cars and brands. But at the global level, which has sort of been a really beautiful sort of like again, transition from the editorial. It's sort of like that step up into the next segment in the genre of what happens in an industry on a global level. And that's been where I've been and it's been incredibly, incredibly awesome journey and it's always an adventure. And I never know where I'm going to be in the world, which is also what I love so much about cars specifically is that it does take me commercially all over the world. They go, well, we want to shoot in, well, I guess not Russia anytime soon, but if you want to, we want to shoot in Russia. So we just go off to Russia or the middle of Spain or wherever. So that's been the journey up until to where I am. And it's sort of gave birth to stockably. Yes, so we're talking about media, editorial content, globality of it. So let's talk about stockably. Who are you? What is the problem yourself in as a company? So really the fact that I've been a creator sort of was the birthplace of why I was able to identify an issue that I want to do try and fix. And now is really like as I was doing these big commercial jobs, the licenses and the usage that went behind those jobs weren't always being recorded in a way that was sort of like the right sort of way. These records were just sort of somehow go very missing somewhere or someone that was in charge of looking after them, so it doesn't work at the agency anymore. And so really there was this not maliciously so, but just a logistical issue when it came to how usage and media was being recorded. That would just often not go recorded the way it needed to be done. So that's me as the creator could come back and go, well listen, this media usage has expired now. What is happening? Are we renewing the license? Are we seeing the license? Are we? What is being done with my media that are creating commercial that you are using for commercial gain? So really that's that. Which I think is just absolutely compounded in today's day and age with internet and like click, copy paste. Oh, I can't download it, so I'm just going to capture screenshot. And there are so many ways to get around what belongs to who and having your rightfully so your name attached to what is your creative property. Yeah, I can imagine. Because you think back of these kind of like iconic photos of maybe Marilyn Monroe or something and you can remember the photo. But yeah, who took it? We may or may not. And who owns the rights to those images really? I mean, well for those Marilyn ones, it's most probably getty because getty is a massive conglomerate in the in the rights management segment. So they do that and also they love archival stuff which is great because that's an example of trying to look after rights and management of usage. My agent actually also does the same thing with South African artists and content like that. He makes sure that it gets maintained and it's great to see it's really great that people do still care about this because really it's the people that sort of don't care about it that sort of create the problem. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. And I think this is a really great segue into today's topic actually. Yes, which is revolutionizing media copyright and ownership for a prosperous future on blockchain. And the question is how do we manage a global industry of media copyright and usage fairly? So could you please share with us like a high level about this industry about what's going on in the world? And then why did you choose this question? So on the high level at any point in time like right now in KTAM, there are probably five to ten different media productions going on. These could be commercials for Coca-Cola or any brand that has come to this country or it's a local brand, but there's this creation of the commercial project, a creative media project where in the end the consumer sees a TV commercial, a 50 second TV commercial. But behind that commercial are hundreds of people, teams and agencies and contracts. And there are so much logistics that go into media creation, especially on the commercial segments, because everything has to be above board. You have to, everyone has to be signed and represented. And there's even some unions also that come into play with that. So in the commercial sphere of creation, there's a lot of logistics and so many, so many moving parts. Now if you zoom out from that, there one production can have 100, 200 different copyright contracts and usage contracts that all go into every talent person that's in that commercial has an individual copyright and individual usage contract for that commercial. There are so many moving parts. So when you zoom out and you look at how many of these are being created, just in a city, you have absolutely thousands and then you zoom out and look at the content, a hundred of thousands, and then you look at it globally and it's absolutely millions. Now you take all these millions and there is no way yet that all of them are working coherently that you have an ecosystem where you can track all uses contracts around the world for any project with any sphere or any industry. So that's really what gave birth to the choice of how we want to do build. Is that we looked at, well, what are we building for? We're building for trying to create something that definitely doesn't exist now, but we would like to see it exist in the next five to ten years. And as far as how structure and record-keeping and the technology that's associated with that, blockchain really is that technology. So it's really it's not a, there's a saying about trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Choosing blockchain really was because of how we would like to future-proof the record-keeping and that structure, not because we think blockchain is the best thing or the only solution to the way of doing it. But it's just how we've decided to build it. And it's I think maybe of what it currently exists, one of the best options for it. And in five to ten years might be something else, but for now that's what we're working with. You know, the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of blockchain is cryptocurrency. Are you, when you're talking about this chain of rights, this chain of history and data, we're not talking about money, are we like what other type to me it's like it sounds probably silly, but like to utilize blockchain outside of something that is dollars is different to me. Like how does this function? Yeah, so really blockchain is just the structure that which is going to record all the records. But what's nice about it is that cryptocurrency, that lives natively on blockchain as well. So stuckably isn't based to be a cryptocurrency. Stuckably is just the company that is helping you keep all your records in place in an immutable way that is always accessible and it's intangible with, it will work cooperatively with all your platforms as you need to log into them. And then that does tie in as you mentioned with cryptocurrency is you can choose to have a cryptocurrency wallet with stuckably because we're living natively on blockchain. So that's a really future role we see it coming in as because we would love to be able to see transactions happening on the platform so that when you need to renew your contract instead of then having to still in real life go and say, hey listen, your contract has expired, please pay me again for it and you make your invoice and you wait for them to pay you, we could all just happen used have that happening instantaneously on the stuckably platform. And that's sort of really that future proofing that we're coming into is that everyone can have an identity, their identity unstuckably as a creator, as a production, as an agency. And when all of that talks to each other beautifully, when it comes to your seeing who own something, it's all there because all the associated with your identity on blockchain. So but that's sort of maybe more the I think the the guys that are really into blockchain sort of like that sort of talk, but really that's that's the next five years when people are much more at sort of a depth familiar with what blockchain and cryptocurrency is going to do in our modern world. So yeah. And it makes a lot of sense because I mean you're talking with something that's immutable, but I'm also curious because contracts well they're valid are immutable, but then they can change. So it's not like we're going back to previous blocks of updates, something we're just adding a new block to the chain and then this makes things much easier faster. Well you have you have the record being updated instantaneously and it's associated with really cool things like smart contracts which then can do things, they're really they functional, their utility. It's not so much the value of now that contracting renewed because that value was tied into a monetary value because it's a real world contract. It's not some just I mean it does it does live in the real world, but the record keeping the ultimately the one that's going to live forever behind behind the paper trail is the one that lives on stuckably. So that's the one that is always going to be the master file. So that no one can ever come back and say hey that contract wasn't filed at that stage. You can say well unfortunately not the records are what they are. So it takes a lot of that gray area out of it and that's sort of what I've experienced as that pain point coming back to me as a creator. What I experienced over the years is that when I went back and said hey listen that contract has expired we need to renew that contract we need to continue using my piece of media. They go okay well we can't find the records so well what do we do now and what can I do and it's a way to a way human error. Exactly and it's not always malicious and like it's not like people are there and like trying to swindle people out of contracts and rightly so usage rights that belong to them. It really it sort of goes out of mind out of out of place out of mind so it's that that we're trying to fool that gap. We're trying to bring in something it takes out the human error but also that takes out the friction of getting those contracts renewed. So as a creator I want you to pay me again much quicker if that's a frictionless experience. If I can say click this button and you've repaid me that's it. He would that's a much frictionless way to go about as a creator getting my client to renew their contracts with me then saying okay well I now need another purchase order from your agency and then when I get it I've to put on my invoice and then I send my invoice to you and then it goes your accounts department then it's with them for 30 days and then I have to waste another 60 before I get my money out. This is how the real world is still currently operating but this is sort of like where as we sort of go forward and people understand what cryptocurrency and how it can be linked to native stable tokens that's how we want to be paid in the future. I don't want to have to have this insane long paper trail before I can get paid and also that's where the sort of prosperity aspect comes in is that I can now start renewing my media at a much faster rate than having to manually sit and do that. It's just it's a lot of it's a lot of human human work that's currently happening there which is a completely unnecessary. And then I think I imagine that gets amplified when you're talking about this on the global scale in terms of having to exchange rates like where you live versus where the business is taking place. I don't know. Yeah I mean so many in the States has a building filled with six levels of lawyers and their job is just a new usage contracts. I mean that is a lot of man hours going into something that really could be a lot of easier process. I mean look I know there's there's laws and regulations and every country has theirs. But what's beautiful about Stuckbli is that you don't need to use the contracts that Stuckbli uses. We just give you the place to put your contracts. So those contracts still remain the IP or whoever put those together because there's a lot of there's a lot of IP and work that goes into every corporate contracts that they put into place. They don't want that shared with their competitors. So again we're not it's sort of like a very fluid system. I'm curious how this work for example I'm an artist who wants to protect my designs or I don't know. So I have this technology that's helping me to record to the keep track of it with the contracts. And you mentioned that there are different kind of regulations out there in the world. So do you provide this kind of consulting services where you for example I'm someone who wants to promote something I'm just thinking out that in China for example. No that's that's a great question. So you know what eventually eventually we probably will because that me as a creator I very much have the creators welding at heart. And I think that's also why being the CEO of the company has sort of it makes it feel good that what I'm creating is for a global economy of creators because I've got your well being at heart because I have been there and still am there. I absolutely love what I do. So that consulting service I'm pretty sure at some point yes we would love to offer something like that to help create and sort of understand how you can use technology to reserve your copyrights and but still in a way that's sort of better than what's been available in a way that every time an artwork is sold whether it's in real life or it's the digital artwork is what a lot of people forget about is that. NFT is very much everyone says oh what's a JPEG of a monkey really worth but NFT is really the the opposite. Well they suppose it's like anything it's worth what you say it's worth. Exactly but also it's what it's linked to it's what that's what that contract says I owe you for owning this thing. I think what was so great was Gary Vee I mean he's such an advocate for NFTs and he really is a bullet bullet at the horns worth it and I absolutely love his enthusiasm but he was the first one that really sort of helped people understand that because he's an FTs with sketches hand drawn sketches it was like Rudolph the reindeer whatever and it was this hand drawn sketch but that was the NFT but what he well and sort of helped people understand was that was your ticket into my conferences this got you a 15 minute breakfast with me which is exclusive as hell because I mean everyone once they time with Gary Vee and sort of that helped people understand that it's not the NFT it's not the actual image or that that's really the value it's what it represents and that's really how again as artists we can go well either this digital file is the value this is my creation and once you buy it you own the rights to that and I have I'm agreeing that you now own the rights that and it's a one of one I can never use that again that's actually that contract that has just happened when you buying NFT I think artists themselves sort of like need to just sort of be aware of that that you can't just be selling that same NFT as a one of one so just a whole lot of people because essentially you're breaking your own contract as a creator so really the willy-wanker golden ticket yes it's it's it really it has it has to live and abide by that because really that's that's what the contract is so in the commercial world really these contracts are a little bit more common we understand that as a model as an artist as a music artist that if I license my music to you as Sony or whatever to use it in a movie I know for as long as that movie is playing I'm getting my contract from that everyone completely understands that but when it comes to sort of the more graphic artists the the painters the photographers the videographers the the the more creative side then that goes out the window they go well why should we pay you that we're just using your media and suddenly this is also that that fights that's we that's I'm sort of certainly passionate about being a creator is that I people need to understand that there is a commercial value that's being derived from something and that means that person must be compensated just because you're a famous musician doesn't make it right and if you're a photographer it makes it wrong so yeah so famous musician and a not famous musician yes that actually have a question related to that so this is an investment that you need to do to protect your work for but for example artists that are beginning this journey how is this accessible how accessible is this for those kind of artists well with stuck of Lee specifically the artist onboarding artists is part of our second phase of our build because we're still we're still building and developing so the second phase really is where we bring once we have all the agencies and those and those entities that utilize the media then we bring the creatives then we're going well now you have a platform that you can directly sell your media to these agents that are the ones that are licensing media so it's sort of we're going about them in a different way as well as instead of saying to the creators well give us your media and we'll try sell it for you we're first actually building a company that serves the media industry and then going well hey let's slot in creators underneath this with the same beautiful system with licensing and and being able to track that licensing and making sure that artist is paid under that beautifully so yeah that's definitely part of the second phase of of how we want to bring creators into especially the commercializing of media I think that the stock library media has definitely cheapens what people perceive media to be they go well why why should I buy your image for a thousand dollars if I can get it off stock for one dollar but the difference is if you're using it for commercial gain and commercial media usage and I you want my piece of media well the price is what I say it is and being the owner this is the power that you have so yeah it's it's sort of helping the artists sort of like not take their power back but helping them see that that really they they don't need to always take the raw end of the deal but having a platform that ensures that they get paid pay it's one of the first steps in making that happen yeah I think it certainly is in terms of like the media companies I suppose the agencies how how large or like what's your client base is this smaller agencies is this the sonies of the world like it how is that kind of balancing things out as well in terms of I'm an agent but I don't have six floors of people lawyers working for me right so yeah stock of me so you don't exactly so let's talk about how that's not just for the artists themselves and the creators but also the people who are you know distributed in this and creating how does that level the playing field so to speak so really the the question is how do we make how do we make your life easier and on the the B2B segment of that is really as the agencies and the production companies than the model agencies the all the all the moving parts that go into commercial media production have the same issue is that they they need to be putting in these man hours to keep these records updated or at least they should be they're not which is the caveat to that so really the question how do we make that easier for them so at the moment we we in in talks with a lot of the productions and we're going to them and saying well what are your issues what are your problems how what are you struggling with in the early stages of coming together with stockably and and also with my business partners and and path that's here with me in k town we we really sort of like had this idea that we wanted to run with but then sort of like as I as we sort of flesh this out and sort of building this out and realize that you have to talk to your market first you can't just run headlong and build something that you think your market once because then you're like two years into a build and a million dollars into dev costs and and you've built something that no one really wants so again me being a creative is I was able to go back to my industry because these production companies and its ad agencies these are the people have been working with for the last decade so really the end there was it was neutral friends already so I could go in with them and talk to them and just be like how are you dealing with xyz what are you struggling with and they would just talk very freely because I was something that they've worked with so that was really and also I wasn't it wasn't co it's I was very up front that I'm trying to build something to make their lives easier and then of course when you ask someone how can you make your life easier then the flood gets open in there and everyone loves to talk about problems and that's when you really you shut up and you sit back and you just like them down and then you talk to the next agency and you talk to the next person and at the end of the week you've got a hundred things that people are struggling with things that they hate and you really then just whittle that down you go well what can we address how can we group these together and that's sort of like how you start refining your your focus as a company because in the in the beginning we sort of were very broad we were just sort of like thinking blockchain and and NFTs were all the hacks so how do we bring that in and then how do we bring an artist and it was very all over the place and it really it took talking to the markets you sort of understand well how do we narrow this down how do we really build something that is actually a viable product not something that we think people are going to want because honestly if we're done that we're built completely the wrong thing so and that's and it's a continual process I mean we still talking to them as we go we'll show them this and go so what do you think of this how do you enjoy this and then they give you feedback and your iterates and so yeah so we we're really fortunate to sort of like have gotten to that step quite early on as a company I think listening to the YC community and and all the incredible channels that are on YouTube you learn a lot it's sort of really and talking to investors we've been talking to investors for for a few months and also it's opened your eyes as to what's happening globally and of course y'all at the moment right now is in November 2022 it is probably the worst time in the world to do any sort of fundraising yeah the fundraising blockchain crypto crypto but you know what but that's the great thing is that we're not really sort of dependent on what that happening there in a in a in a commercial sense because we're still building for a real world problem solved so it's like you know cryptocurrency could drop to zero but that's great we still have blockchain we're still building on the structure the immutability and consistency which is beautiful and I really appreciate it you know we're going to ask you about your words of wisdom and your company culture and I think you already naturally touched on that in terms of just your ability to foresee and and speak to the market pivot even if even if it wasn't along with your original idea which actually reminds me of a show we had in Bibi last week with trusty care Joseph Schneider he he was mentioning how kind of like you like you start with this idea of how can I help the artist and his initial ideas how can I help patients you know get through tough times with health insurers but realizing that I actually have to go the best place to start is with insurers themselves and in your case the best place to start is with the agencies themselves because with the insurers with the agencies therefore the patients and the the artists are going to follow right and so even though it's a different path perhaps I think the end result is is ultimately what you what you're looking for and what you're wanting no I mean I I care about my industry and and I work in my industry at a global level so it's like it would be very sort of never mind it to just think well how do I do this for the South African market or for Cape Town it really it's something that I I can really sort of bite into and it's one of the reasons why it's been it's one of the the passions behind biting into the project and taking it on as CEO was the fact that it's so closely tied with a passion of mine of this industry and you know it's it's I could carry on the rest of my life trying to create a brand called Seagrim Pierce but this is something that I could actually do to you know it not change the world but definitely help shape it and just sort of like tighten it up a little bit and just help it in a direction that myself as an artist if I could I imagine I deals media industry that I want to work in that's the one I want to work in one that sort of that he's very fair and accurate and so yeah it's a great burn to to bite into so and it's I think it's super timely to particularly with what's happening in the world at large there are more and more creators happening we have this freedom and the technology and the building for us to use and create and so it's it's not going anywhere that's for sure I mean we're shifting to more and more of I think a a knowledge worker creator worker environment and it definitely makes sense well Seagrim we've come to the end of our half hour today if you can believe it thank you so much for sharing your time your experience your knowledge and about stockably with us and just a whole new perspective on what how blockchain can actually be used for me it was very enlightening say thank you thank you wish you and stockably nothing but success hang on just one moment before we go out there before we do we'd like to remind our viewers that there's no show tomorrow we usually do have Thursday shows but tomorrow is thanks giving so happy Thanksgiving yes safe travels good food hopefully doesn't get too intense intense or around the the family table but but do join us next week next week is a full

      " Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of Dojo Live this Thursday's at 10th of January 1st, 2022. It is the final show of the week and the first show of the month. How about that? My name is Kim Lantas and it's my pleasure to be hosting today. Joining me is co-host is Colleen Dibble. Hi Colleen. Hi Colleen. Oh and Matt who surprised us he just popped in. Look at that. What do you call it? Late with style or something like that Matt. I was running back from the A's. Cool. Well thank you for joining us Matt to co-host today and of course the star of today's show is Ryan Myers head of product and data science right at manifest climate. Thank you for joining us Ryan. Yeah my pleasure. Said to be here. Yeah all the way in Toronto. So hey I'm kidding. That is a thing. Yeah. I really enjoyed the moves from Brother Bear they got me gay going. So yes so today we're going to be talking about data driven approaches to climate management. Before we get into that topic however we'd really like to get to know you a bit better Ryan if you could tell us a bit about your passion, your story. And how that led up to manifest climate. Thank you. Yeah so maybe I'll just start with like a quick background of like the first half of my life I kind of moved around quite a bit actually as I just alluded to in our pre show conversation. I lived in I was born in Canada. I lived in Barbados for five years I lived in the States near New York for four years. And I was actually in the UK when I was a young kid I used to have a very British accent which is a little mind blowing to watch old family videos. And I graduated high school in the UK as well. And then came back to Canada for undergrad. So yeah I studied bio and undergrad and I was interested in climate change and sustainability back at that time as well. And I knew that that was an area that I wanted to move into. And I after grad after undergrad I went and I got my MBA and right after that I started working at an engineering firm in the sustainability groups. So this is back just over 10 years ago now. And yeah so I was there for just over a year and then I moved into my first ever tech startup. And that was kind of like an ignorance bliss moment of my life where I joined to start up with two other guys in the mid 50s who had been consultants for you know 30 years. None of us knew anything about software. And but we knew that we wanted to democratize what we called sustainable return on investment analysis or kind of business case analysis for the built environment so we could basically make the case for greener infrastructure greener buildings. So I was at that company for four years and learned a lot about how to build and how not to build products and software which was pretty cool. And then transitioned into data science actually from there. So with a bio degree in an MBA I think a lot of people actually in product and software take very non-linear paths to get to where they are for some reason. So that was me as well. Thanks to the trend that we see on this show for sure as well. So coming out of that tech startup experience I was like I really wish I had a stronger technical foundation. So I moved into data science and I worked as a data scientist for three years. Wow. I worked in an AI company in Toronto. And then in 2020 right after COVID hit I actually was working on sales funnel optimization models with machine learning models. And I was like I kind of miss working in climate I miss working in sustainability and so I started sort of reaching out to my network and figuring out what was going on in Toronto at the time. And this new company called Manifest Climate had just started and I got connected to one of the co-founders who's now my boss and been here the last two years. So then I manifest my role started off on the data side of things I kind of actually like started in product a little bit but there was a bigger need on the data side of things. So I moved into helping to create our methodology around how we conduct assessments around how you're disclosing and managing climate at your business. And then I worked on how we're creating that methodology and making sure that we're collecting data in the right way so we can build machine learning models out of that. And then I built our first NLP models and just moved into the role of how to product six months ago. All right. Well, congratulations. That's quite a story. I love it. And I think later in the show where I'm really at going to be asking you about your passion for sustainability and what brought you back to that. But before we do, let's just you touch on this a little bit. But let's talk a little bit more about manifest climate. What you do is accompany the problem that you're solving. Yeah. So we are building one of the world's first climate risk planning solutions at manifest climate. So we help, long story short, we help businesses make the climate transition. So a lot of the time when we talk to companies, they'll say, oh, well, we only have one office or, you know, we're located in such and such a spot. And like we don't have to worry about heavy rainfall or tornadoes or hurricanes. But I think what a lot of companies don't think about is that the acute or chronic physical risks are only one dimension of what's happening with climate change. You also have to pay attention to what's called transition risks. So, you know, when you think about policy or legal risks or regulatory changes, there's shifts in market demand, there's investor pressure, there's reputational risk. And I think different companies take these things into account, you know, to different levels or different degrees. But that's what we help with is we help with all of these things around, all right, what kind of physical risk should we be thinking about? Both in terms of how you're managing it, but also how you're disclosing it internally as well as to your investors. Well, that's super interesting. And so this brings us into the topic that you chose today, of course, and that is data driven approaches to climate management. And really how are climate tech and AI helping businesses with the climate transition? Now, I have to say, as you're explaining what you're doing as a company, one of the first things that kind of comes to my mind is the real life story and the movie made famous by Julie Roberts of Aaron Brockovich, right? Of companies doing wrong as far as the climate is concerned. And I visualized in my mind, you know, this board, these people, a lot of manpower to maybe have traditionally either high such things or make things compliant, right? So let's speak to the tech and the AI component, like, how is this now transitioning? What does this look like on a computer versus boots on the ground? Yeah. Okay, so first of all, with the Aaron Brockovich reference, maybe one of the things they'll say is one of the things that we talk about internally and one of the kind of taglines that we use sometimes is we don't focus so much on how business is affecting climate. As much as how climate change is affecting business, that's kind of how we're approaching it a little bit. The inevitable, like it's sort of like wake up pay attention. Yeah, like it's coming and all this is going to happen and it is happening. And, you know, like the SEC in the US is going to be almost definitely releasing new reporting standards next year. Or even later this year around climate reporting. And a lot of our prospects or other companies are starting to think about this and go like, oh crap, like we have to pay attention to this now and we're going to be forced to disclose on all kinds of topics related to how we're managing climate that our business. And the truth is we're not managing climate in a lot of these different things, right? And so there's, I mean, a bunch of pieces to our software, but maybe I'll just talk about like the broad brushstrokes, which is. The first piece is we need to be able to tell you where you're at, right? In order to know where you're going, you need to understand where you are. And so for that, we analyze public disclosures of our clients and we use a methodology that is based on a series of either existing or emerging regulatory standards, including the SEC. And all of those are based on a framework called TCFD, which you don't really need to know much about except that it is a standard that's being adopted across the world and all of the regulatory standards are based on a flavor of the TCFD and it's all it's all around climate reporting and climate disclosure. So we have a methodology that's based on that and the first step of what we do is we analyze your public disclosures and we can then tell you where you're at and we've basically stayed our, to our clients, we're a proxy for what investors would see. And a major problem in the space is that there's no consistency right now and this is what's changing with regulatory standards, but really there's very limited consistency around how companies are talking about climate, even down to like something like emissions reporting. So in climate change, when you talk about carbon emissions metrics, it's normally broken down into what's called three scopes, those are like three categories of emissions. There's scope one emissions, which are direct emissions. So like if we had to, you know, fire gasoline engine to run the electricity here or something like that, that would forward to run a factory that's direct emissions scope to would be indirect emissions right. So there's lights on in the room that I'm in right now. But there is a power plant that's hundreds of miles away that probably burns some sort of fuel source to produce this electricity set the scope to example scope to two and then scope three would be like I commuter to you today, or you guys commuter to your work or, you know, we produce a service that then has downstream emissions or a product that has, you know, that's an example of scope three emissions. And the reason I bring this up is because even within scope three emissions are the way that we talk about carbon. There's inconsistency around how it's calculated what's incorporated there, what's not. And the same thing goes with disclosure across all the different elements of climate. So one of the things that we're trying to do is we're trying to create a structure to how we assess how companies are assessed in terms of their disclosure and management quality so that you can then be compared in an apples to apples way against everybody else. And then we provide you with data that you can use to say here's where we're ahead and here's actually not to your air and Brockovich point like here's actually it's not all a bad news story here's where we're doing things that are good right because we are doing some things that are good a lot of companies are doing things that are good. And then here where gaps are and based on the data where we're furthest behind here are the things that we should actually focus on first because let's be honest, we can't do everything all at once and normally sustainability teams are pretty small. So with our software, we have natural language processing models that we use to process a lot of documents thousands, tens of thousands of documents so that we can then benchmark you against companies. We can conduct really detailed reviews and then through our software, we provide all this data and assessments and help you to actually make the changes. So Ryan, if I could just ask along those lines, so is it as simple in my hearing you say it's not simple, it's very complicated, but it's almost like you. To set the benchmark to say what good looks like when it comes to climate and sustainability or climate in general, how you managing climate is it, is it right. That's exactly right. In fact, we have a section of the software that's titled what good looks like for each of the action items. Another question I have is because I'm so much into AI, I love it ML and LP, it can provide so much information. Is there a section that your software provides to have suggestions on how to do things better, like maybe a more energy efficient building, you know, I'm curious. Totally. So we kind of go in steps. So step one is we conducted a disclosure review. Step two is we provide you with a gap assessment. Step three, which is kind of in line with this kind of step two A, is we rank those to you understand what to do first. And then you can basically think of it as like if anyone out there follows like uses agile or uses Jira, it's kind of like a Jira board where like you've got this set of action items that you can take for either managing or disclosing climate. And you can add those into like a sprint, if you will, it's basically like a climate, you can create a climate action plan. And then within each of those action items, again, using the Jira analogy, there's like a series of what we could call acceptance criteria. So we talk about why does this matter? You know, what does good look like? Why were you assessed the way that you were? How do you compare against others? But then we also kind of have a best practice and peer example repository in our database. So you can actually go and you can see exactly how people, how others, you know, companies similar to you have either managed or disclosed these things. And it's very precise. Like we take you straight into the highlighted context of other documents for your peers or best practice companies. And then yes, we have tools and resources to help you to implement as well. Another big problem is that a lot of people in the climate space or risk who are working on this. Everyone's just kind of like off on their own, like reinventing the wheel, like figuring out how to do this, you know. And everyone's making their own case for their own reasons. And it's some, so teams like that are very small. They have a lot on their plate. And so our job is basically to try and make things easier. So with the TCFD, if you don't mind kind of along those lines, you are making their life easier because that sounds to me there's going to be a set of rules and regulations or compliance requirements that'll be set forth that people will be governed by. Is that possible or is that where it's taking it? Yeah, I wouldn't even. Might even go as strong to say like inevitable like it is coming. Okay. It already this already is implemented. It's already mandatory in the UK. So we're expanding there right now. It is I believe mandatory in Japan New Zealand rolled this out. And these are all like pretty new. It's all in the last couple of years. So that's why like the SEC is now looking at this in a very serious way. The CSA in Canada has this rolled out. The ISSB, which is related to IFRS. So if any of you are at a company that use IFRS accounting standard, that will start implementing this with the ISSB, which is very similar to how the SEC is doing. I'm only realizing now that I'm using quite many abbreviations, but it's coming everywhere is my point. And I think it makes a lot of sense and a tool like manifest climate. It sounds to me like it's sort of like before or even now. There's dewell intentioned blind leading the blind and a lot of slow process, a lot of bumping around. So you come in. What have you seen in terms of maybe like the ROI or like how has this helped speed up in real time for your users, your clients in terms of them meeting compliance, getting to work, even knowing where they want to go getting their faster. And then what does that look like in terms of, you know, the bottom line or any other type of positive outcomes. Yeah. Okay. So in terms of speeding things up like so there's actually two thoughts. One is that we make things more efficient. And the second is that we create new capabilities that wouldn't have been there otherwise. Or we create practically new capabilities. And what I mean by that is, you know, there's some companies that we've spoken to some prospects and some clients actually that we have where they basically have done internally before we started working with them. A version of what we built they, you know, came up with some idea of how to assess themselves. And then they had a bunch of people on their team go and like go through their documents and read every sentence and then figure out, you know, how they're says and then do the same thing like five of their peers. And it takes months of effort to do that, right? It's a trend. It's a huge amount of time. It's around some amount of time to be able to do that. So, of course, obviously we save like that's like a, even if you're talking about the amount of time it takes to start an engagement with us and then get to that same point. It's like an order of magnitude in, you know, in improved efficiency. But obviously we're not just giving you like, you know, the information at a high level and five companies where you're at we go way deeper than that. And the idea is like, you know, a problem in the space and other problem is that a lot of these assessments are like point and time assessments. So companies have somebody come in and they get a stamp on like, okay, here's where you are right now compared to this one standard and like here's where you should improve. But the truth is the standards are all evolving. So in some cases like the ISSC and SEC on a, like on a quarterly basis, they're evolving right now. So the, it's kind of like, you know, you're being assessed and you're being told where you are in a river. And then you're like continuing to float down the river and like, you're like, okay, but that's where you are at that point in time. So the compliance, but like you yourself as a company, it's all the way. The compliance is moving and then what you're actually doing is moving. So everybody's on, if I can use this term, everybody's on this little climate journey. It sounds a little like very squishy. But anyways, everyone's on a climate journey. And it's kind of true. And so yeah, and a lot of the sustainability team or risk team members or whoever's accountable for these changes, they have to stand top of like, who's responsible for, you know, implementing these different things across the organization and coordinating. And so that's why we're kind of creating this workflow tool that makes it easy for people to coordinate. I would think just right now, California, they have the gas powered cars, gas powered cars need to be done. Yeah, 2035. Then then, but you still have though, even though they're going to have electric cars, right, it still applies because they all those electric cars have implications to the climate too, right. Yeah, for sure. And of course, you've run, you mentioned several times comparing companies that by standardizing, I mean, I get the part about the AI, dragging over a longer time and be more efficient and more accurate. It's not the else. But what do you have to compare companies to company? I mean, you notice kosher back is one of your clients, but so it's high. Are you comparing started wearing underwear or what? Yeah, well, good question. But so maybe what I'll say is, we don't compare every account, every company comparison doesn't matter. Like they don't all matter equally, right. So one of the things that, one of the things that we're adding, or I guess that we already have been doing and we're continuing to do, is we allow our clients to select specific companies of interest that they want to be compared against. Yeah, so that's really where it comes in. Because of course, if you're talking about like if you're a multi billion dollar financial institution in the United States, you probably don't care to be compared against, you know, some small retailer and, you know, some other jurisdiction. So of course, yeah, we're taking that. So, but what is the value? What's, what's, oh, I mean, to the company to be compared to appear? Well, two things. Number one, nobody wants to be behind. Everybody, you know, so that's like the first thing. But the second thing is, you know, people want to have examples of what good looks like. And, and we can give them descriptions is like, oh, well, you know, board overseeing climate related metrics four times a year on a quarterly basis. Like that, that's, that's good. But when it comes to like, okay, but how, how are other people communicating this in a really clear way? How are they weaving that into the larger narrative about what their organization is doing? You know, it's just, it's always easier when you're not taking something from zero to one, but you have an example in front of you. And so that's, that's actually one of the more sought after elements in the software right now. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And it makes me think of the power numbers, right? Like, I think I saw this once like a meme in Facebook or something. It had something to do with like the world doesn't need 100, you know, zero. What is it? When you're not producing anything, there's the zero. I just want blank here. Power zero. I don't know, like zero emissions, like my carbon footprint, right? We don't need 100 people with zero carbon footprint. We need, you know, carbon neutral is that? Yeah, but like 10 million, a billion people working toward that imperfect. Right? It doesn't need to be perfect. It needs the numbers in. Totally. And that's where I see kind of where you're headed. I mean, the inevitable is happening. You're going to have to get there. But trying to get that that number and that push behind you. So that said, who's maybe like, who are your users? Like, is there? Are you, are you targeting that? Like the people, the companies who are very much invested in this and interested in it right now? Or are you also trying to do that education piece and just build up that momentum? What's the best approach? That's a really good question. I mean, right off the bat, I'll say it's really hard to educate people and sell at the same time. It's like very hard to do that. So generally, that's not what we're doing. I will say there's a lot of, there's a lot of companies out there who are starting to kind of like get it. Like we would say, like understand this is important. And they understand they have to make this change and they just don't know how to do it. And so, you know, at the end of the day, what we offer is kind of we're really framing it more as a solution where we've got software, but we also have climate experts at our team on our team who kind of help you to use it and then kind of go beyond even what the software can do. Because there's complexity to this implementation. But it's interesting because I've been in the space for over 10 years now. And I've kind of seen even in that, I guess relatively short amount of time, I've kind of seen an evolution from individuals at companies, even when we were trying to make the business case for sustainable design, we were helping people with dollars and cents that we did it my first climate tech startup. People wanted to know the answer to one question, which is like what's in it for me? Right. That's what people wanted to know the answer to. And what we come up against is that there would often be one or two sustainability champions who would love it. But then when it came to the decision makers who weren't necessarily climate champions or sustainability champions who are thinking about supply chain efficiencies or thinking about, you know, they're cashflowers, they're thinking about whatever. This just wasn't as important. But what we're seeing now, and this was kind of accelerated by COVID as well because people are realizing that these things, these risks are actually not so far off and actually were more interconnected than we maybe gave credit for and like all these different things. And the climate is starting to change like the narrative is changing from this is going to happen to holy crap, this is happening. Right. So with all of that at play at the same time and you're seeing buying patterns shift. There's still it's not as mainstream, I think as it should be, but I can tell you we don't have to educate as much anymore because there are a lot more companies out there where it's not just the sustainability team that's saying we need this. It's the risk team and it's the senior executives. It's a CEO. It's the board. So that kind of helps. Thank you. I think I think that's encouraging. It is encouraging. I'll be it still frightening. Actually, Matt, I think just the other day I saw you make a comment on LinkedIn something about glorifying. It was it was a post on the you know the generation before like drinking out of water hoses. Walking the school both ways in the snowstorm kind of mentality and you said yeah, but let's not glorify it. We as a generation have created a mess and now we're responsible for cleaning it up something about sort. Yeah, it was a post in LinkedIn glorifying the past. So this is like me, American, and it struck me out way and my response was I was one of those kids in the picture. So don't don't tell you about them. We've made a mess. We ignore all the signals coming out of something like that. And this is this is the least one way of people who want to do a graduate will have the signals and we'll have in a way that will make the regulatory agency. Desk it's let's hope that a lot more companies are not ignoring this is festing through an all yeah, we're terrible. Yeah, we're terrible. But once you have to zoom in front of you, I think it's harder like you said people are learning people. I mean the water is here. Right. It's going right. To be honest, it's not just about doing the right thing anymore. It's just good business. And that's a big part of what we talk about and what we're seeing more and more in the market. By the way, I apologize. There's construction going on behind me. I don't know if you can hear that. Great. So we're actually we're actually at the final few minutes of the show today. And I wanted to bring it back to your story at the very beginning. You mentioned wanting to come back to sustainability. So share a bit about us not necessarily the sustainability, but the idea of passion and choosing to work in something that is actually meaningful to you. What was that that process like for you and what my our viewers. Emulate and learn from that. And I don't think I'm probably that dissimilar from a lot of people in the sense that I just want to feel passionate about what I'm doing. And for me, that passion was around climate change and it always has been. And I kind of fell into technology, to be honest with you. I fell into data science and product management. And I love product. I love building great products. And I find it really exciting. You have to think great cross functionally across bunch of different areas and unite a bunch of different things together. So I love that. And that's part of the reason that I went into data science as well so that I could kind of connect more dots. So I'm not sure. I mean, my goal was to move it to work in something I was passionate about and ideally be able to make a living at it. And so far it's working out okay. Like, would be nice. But you know, it all depends on what your motivation is right like my primary motivation wasn't, you know, making bank. It was like making a difference and making it, you know, having a good career and making a difference. So that's you've got to you got to set your priorities right. And the final question then to the company culture of manifest. What was it about the company, their culture and where you're at now that made you say this is it? Honestly, I sometimes you just get lucky and you know, I did have a sense just reviews obviously of what this was going to be. But like, as I'm sure you guys know the listeners know you never really know after interviews. You only really know when you get in. And Manifest has a lot of heart. And we have a lot of smart people that are trying to be like be smart about the way that we try to make a difference with climate. And it's about the mission, but it's also about making businesses better. And everybody at Manifest is totally just bought into that. And we care about the mission, but there's also just so much heart that comes straight from the top from our co founders in terms of the way that we operate as a company. You know, we put a lot of emphasis on not having like a super structured, debatably to our detriment sometimes not as structured a hierarchy, you know, not as much management as some places because we want people to be more autonomous and be able to contribute in the way that they think is most effective. And so you combine that with the heart. We all care about each other. We're all trying to do something that we care about. I think every place has things to work on, but I think we're doing a lot of things right on that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Ryan, for joining us today to share your story, your wisdom, and more about Manifest climate in the way that what you're doing is useful to pretty much every business out there. So get on board folks with your climate transition. Also, of course, Matt and Colleen, thank you for joining us today. And listen, one final announcement, the final show of the week, but we do have our recap show coming up on Monday morning to introduce next week show. It's a full week, both Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday here at Doja Live. But remember, next week is the transition to 10 o'clock Pacific. We'll no longer be going live at noon, but 10 o'clock Pacific. So thank you and see you then everyone. Have a great weekend. Thank you. Thanks so much.\n"

      " Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of Doja Live, our first episode this week, Tuesday November 15th, 2022. My name is Kim Lentus and it's my pleasure to be hosting along with America Guerrero today. Hello, good morning, good afternoon, good evening for those for the other set of the war. Hello everybody. Exactly. Hello and of course we're here to welcome Sterling Douglas who is the co-founder and CEO of Chowly today, the most important person on today's show. Thank you for joining us Sterling. Thanks for having me Kim. Yeah, it's gonna be a fun conversation all about food. If you haven't picked that up already by the name of the company, Chowly and we're going to be talking about tech and restaurants and practical insights for those of you who want to get started, but before we do, we'd love to get to know you a bit more Sterling. If you could share us, share with us a bit about who you are, your story, your passion and how that's led up to Chowly. Thank you. Yeah, of course. I think that there's always been a couple of things that have always driven me and always been very competitive, always played a lot of sports, but always been incredibly curious. Whether it be the type of video games I played growing up, I love games like roller coaster, tycoon, and sim golf, and all these ones we were managing and creating different things. There was always this curiosity and this problem-solving part of me that was always there. Went to college, became an actuary, which for those of you who don't know what an actuary is, it's like a combination of finance and statistics. It's probably one of the nerdiest professions you can go into, but it taught me a lot of really valuable skills. After about two years doing that, management consulting. My parents would be what's that along came poly or something? Yes, I always reference movies and art shows. It's a little different than they portrayed in the movie, but you know, great. I was glad that the movie existed, so at least people had an idea of what an actuary might be. But I had a great job. I had really cool clients I worked on. The work was pretty interesting, but there was always this little question that every project we'd work on would start with. It would be kind of what did we do last time? We'd take that and we'd iterate and then we'd kind of deliver that to our clients. And so everything I worked on was kind of a Frankenstein monster. I never got to work on something I really knew. And so the problems that we were solving, there was kind of always the same playbook to run. So I basically kind of set out at that point knowing I wanted to start a company, and solve different problems. I started a mobile ordering app for bars back in 2014. That company ultimately failed, but after about six months led me to the discovery of Charlie. Back in the very end of 2015 and early 2016, there were about six, seven years later, here we are. And so that's a little bit about my story and kind of what drove me to be company, the entrepreneur that I am today. Awesome. And it definitely sounds like a story, excuse me, of endurance. I love that. So let's talk about Charlie, where you are today, who is Charlie, what does your company do, and what's the problem that you're solving? Sure. Charlie is a restaurant technology company. And so we're basically helping restaurants of all sizes adopt new technologies, specifically in the off-premise space. If you're a restaurant and you're trying to add different services like Grubhub or Uber Eats or DoorDash, this is going to actually be somewhat daunting and complex, you know, addition to your restaurant. And so Charlie basically simplifies that. We make sure all of the systems are connected. We're going to integrate it directly to a restaurant's point of sale. And you know, point of sale is basically how restaurants are raw. And that's what they run credit cards, that's what stores the menu, prints receipts, and so all that stuff. And so what we're able to do is make sure that the data that lives on Grubhub is the same that lives on the restaurant's point of sale. So that when you as a consumer are ordering food, the menu you're ordering from is accurate. And the order when you send it into the point of sale is correct. So you actually get the right. Wow. So that makes a lot of sense. And I think, I mean, I'm used to work in the restaurant industry. It's been a long time back when I was at my college days. It's been over 20 years. A lot has changed a sense then. So it'll be interesting to see what this kind of looks like. So before we get into that, let's introduce the topic of today's show as chosen by you. Which is making tech accessible for small to mid-size restaurants, particle insights into how hopeful, hopeful entrepreneurs can begin carving a path within the restaurant's tech industry. So please join us. Where do you think this topic is important for today's show? Sure. I think one of the more important aspects of running a restaurant today is that technology just plays a huge part in that. Everything from how consumers are ordering food, how they're paying for food, how they're leaving reviews, how restaurants market is now moved from kind of the old days of coupons and mail layers and leaving flyers under doors to now all being digital SEO driven and so many different things. So restaurants are forced to basically bring on this use of technology if they want their businesses to be successful. And most restaurant tours, this isn't something that they grew up with. You know, they got into starting a restaurant because of hospitality. They got into it because they wanted to make great food, provide a great experience. And so adopting this new technology can be really daunting, especially for the small and mid-size restaurants who don't have big IT groups or large marketing budgets. And so what Charlie really strives to do is make sure that same tech that is powering large thousand location national chains is accessible and available so that your small mom and pop restaurants that we love so much in our neighborhoods can be just as successful and have the same type of interactions with consumers. I think that makes a really good point. And I guess that makes my first question when it comes to tech and restaurant tours and these mom and pop small restaurants in particular. You as Charlie, is that like one of the first steps that you have to overcome is even convincing restaurant tours that technology is whether they like it or not they have to face this new reality or our most restaurant tours kind of on board with this and actively searching for ways to increase tech. Now it's a great question. I think back when we first started in 2015, 2016, we definitely had a lot more of those conversations. You know, why do I need this? Why do I need Neil Grubhub? You know, I have my own, you know, customers love coming in. And we saw this transition coming into effect where you saw a larger and larger percentage of borders occurring digitally instead of in person. And you started seeing a larger and larger amount of borders occurring off premise, you know, for delivery or for pickup rather than, you know, on premise and in person. And so you definitely saw this transition occurring. And then COVID hit and then it was just a mass acceleration. Now it's always the I know I need technology. I know it can help my restaurant. But I don't know where to start or I may not know how or how do I use the 10 different systems that I think I need and try to get them in a way that, you know, these restaurant toys can understand. Yeah. Yes. I know that here in Mexico, I will around the globe, most restaurants are starting to use this technology because of the pandemic. How do you think that the future will look like if it wouldn't be for the pandemic situation in terms of technology and restaurants? I still think that it was going to happen. I mean, you can, if you look at, you know, a lot of things that were happening in 2019, the year before the pandemic, you were seeing companies like Drodash and Uber Eats, you know, explode, right? You were seeing, I think, over $4 billion of venture capital being poured into restaurant technology companies. It was still happening. And it was actually happening at a pretty quick rate. What we saw in COVID was, you know, a very drastic, drastic acceleration to, you know, instead of moving quickly and going through all these restaurants, it was in a matter of weeks, every restaurant needed to use it, because it was the only way they could save business. For sure. So let's talk a bit more about the technical side of this, the point of sale and all these integrations that are happening. What are the main problems that companies are facing? You, for example, mentioned 10 different systems. So you came in, I'm guessing to help sort of streamline this because the way I understand it is traditionally restaurants would have to have this as my device for Uber Eats. This is my device for Drodash, etc. etc. And maybe even other things that aren't even coming to my mind. But what are the complications? You know, really, if we could start at the bad news sort of first, and then shift into what this is becoming? If you're a restaurant and you want to sign up for the big market place, we'll just take the big three Uber Eats, Drodash and Grump Hub. Each one of them is going to ship you a tablet. On that tablet, that's how you're going to receive orders. That's how you're going to need to make menu changes. So let's say you're running your restaurant. It's busy. You've got a bunch of people at the door running the pickup orders or either order at, order on premise. And then you've got an order comes in on the Uber Eats tablet. You're going to hear a dinging. Now one of your staff members have to go there, grab that tablet, look at the order, manually enter it into the point of sale. So that fires to the kitchen. Meanwhile, you're making staff on premise weight. And then one of your kitchen, you know, people yells out, hey, we're out of, you know, green peppers. Okay, well now I've got a, you know, market on my point of sale. So that customers here aren't going to be able to order it. Then I got to go to my Uber Eats tablet. I got an 86 there. Then I got to go to my Grump Hub tablet. I got an 86 there. Then I got to go to my door desk. I got an 86 there. And it's a, it's a really complicated operation to basically keep all of this data, you know, streamline. Meanwhile, you're still having to run a restaurant, which by itself without these distractions is a relatively, deceptively difficult business model to do. And so when you get chowling to place, basically the tablet's could put into order. Right. Orders come in. They automatically fire to the kitchen. The kitchen knows what they need to make. When you run out of green peppers, you hit it on your point of sale once. It'll automatically update all your platforms to make sure customers aren't ordering something that you're out of. And all of a sudden, what was a really big pain and complicated and, you know, had all these funny terms like tablet hell and all these things, that goes away. Right. And now you can get back to focusing on making great food and the guests that are right in front of you to provide a good experience. What? Go ahead and wear a gun. Could you share with us how has been the customer loyalty shifted into the age of food delivery apps? Because I have a mom. She doesn't want to have a nap on herself when she doesn't want to work in that way. She has this difficulty to start learning about tech. I don't know why, but it's easier. She can spend less time doing this by an app. So how is this customer-logility transition? Sure. I mean, on one side of those, my mom was a little bit resistant. She always like calling into the restaurant. But then once she got a pretty good experience with, you know, Panera Bread app, which is one of her favorite restaurants, she downloaded that one. And then once she got into ordering that, she was like, well, DoorDash is actually pretty easy to use, and then I have a lot more restaurants. So I think that you'll see consumer adoption even in some of our older generations as they realize that it becomes easier. But the point that you're bringing up around customer loyalty is also really interesting. And what, you know, because what ends up happening is as a restaurant, if a customer orders directly from you, you know, there's no commission, there's no marketing fee. If they order from you through a DoorDash, for example, DoorDash charges a commission fee. They're going to take anywhere between 20 and 30 percent of the total order size. And that's going to go to DoorDash and be taken away from the restaurant. This is charging for marketing fees for the delivery fees and some other things as well. And so restaurants are kind of going through this decision process where I get more orders from DoorDash. But it's a little bit more expensive channel. I can create my own channel, right? Let's say if, you know, it came you owned your own burrito shop, right? And then it was me, you know, con burritos. I could go to kinsburritos.com in order from it. And then you wouldn't have to pay for that commission. So as a restaurant, you have different channels. So the same way a lot of tech companies and a lot of other business are looking at all these different marketing channels. Restaurants are now having to do the same thing and they have to figure out how much do I invest in this channel, my direct one, how much do I invest in third parties, how much do I invest in, you know, in Instagram and all these different things. And so it's becoming much more complicated for restaurants, specifically because of that customer loyalty point that you bring up. It's probably able to help in terms of consultation, let's say, in terms of business models, where certain restaurants are at or even where they're located, pull their client faces, and offer ideas or even how to set up perhaps your own website. How is that working or is that maybe what's coming next? We ourselves were not a consulting shop. We're a technology company, but a lot of times we are where restaurants start on kind of their digital journey. A restaurant knows they need to adopt technology, they see all the ads for their marketplaces, non-minority, loyalty, dispatch, voice automation, and whatever the new technology is going out, and they know that they need to do it. And so a lot of times, Charlie's a really great place to start, because we'll work with restaurants, we'll help them get on the third party marketplaces. That's usually the easiest place for restaurants to start. One, because the third party marketplaces do make it really easy, they take care of a lot of the work working with consumers, advertising them, posting menus, and fulfilling the deliveries. And so when we talk about that, that digital journey for restaurants, a lot of times they start with third parties. Then we're going to start asking them about their first party ordering. How can customers order directly from you, your loyal ones who are going to do repeat orders? Then we're going to be looking at how can we make your delivery more efficient? Should you be bringing on maybe one or two your own drivers, should be leveraging national networks? And then we get really late in that digital journey, and we get more complicated, we can talk about virtual restaurants. You have your own brand, we've got a little extra kitchen capacity, can we fill that with purely virtual restaurants in there? And so there's kind of this this climb that they have to do, and a lot of times, Charlie ends up playing a key role, kind of guiding them on, you know, kind of throughout that journey. Now that's that's really amazing. So let's talk about Charlie in terms of the restaurant tours and the people that are working with them, right? In terms of like what would the onboarding experience sort of look like, is it as easy as turning this on, or what does that look like in terms of your own experience with the interface and in user experience of your product? Yeah, for a restaurant to get onboarded with Charlie or with any technology, is actually one of the reasons that we exist in the first place, because what we found is that it was really hard for a restaurant to start. And so we think about why it was difficult and there's a number of deeply technical reasons on why getting started with some of these new technologies, so difficult. And we think about what the focus has always been on Charlie. And so when we've looked at onboarding restaurants, we basically took the existing model that we saw with every technology company that are restaurant and work with. And we're like, how do we do the opposite of that? How do we make it super, super easy? How do we make it so that a restaurant doesn't really think about it? And so every step of the way when we thought about onboarding new restaurants, we've always minimized how much work the restaurant actually has to do. And in the early days, there was a lot of work that we had to do. And so it would take over a month to get them live, depending on how complicated their menu was. But the way that we did it was we basically did all of the work. So during that month, we would be looking at their menu, we'd be looking at any duplicates, any spelling errors, any issues that they had, making sure that by the time we were done, when we were posting that menu, it was really clean so that restaurants didn't have to do a lot of work. And so we've kept that, consistent throughout the whole time of Charlie. The only difference is that 30-day mark has just continually made progress. And so after a couple of years, we got that down to three weeks. And we got it down to two weeks. And we got it down to one week. Now, when you look at onboarding with Charlie, we have a solid 20% of our restaurants that are out within less than 24 hours. And we can really, really, really quick. And most of the restaurants that we're onboarding are getting onboarded within a week or less. And so not only is it requiring them to do very little work, but now it's happening faster and faster. And we're always pushing the envelope on that to try to get this as quick and as famous as possible for our restaurants. I really like that sort of reverse engineering approach of like, what should we not do? And now let's figure out how to make that happen. And in terms of the people who are working with restaurants, those people who are now no longer having to deal with four or five sticks different tablets and it's all on one point of sale, what does this look like for the employee experience? And then also, how are you seeing this increase the customer experience for restaurants? Yeah, no, I mean, the number one kind of reuse of that time that was previously spent managing tablets ends up going towards more customer face time. If you have a staff member at a restaurant who's running a register and is dealing with customers in person, sometimes they literally turn their back to those customers so that they can mess with the tablet. Once you get everything integrated, they now get to provide much less undivided, or excuse me, much more undivided attention to the customers that are right there in front of their face. And so you're going to get a better customer experience. I think the other thing that restaurants look at a ton, too, is they're seeing a lot of struggles in the labor market and having increased costs. And this is an opportunity for them to actually get cost savings that are going to help that restaurant potentially make it through the recession and other kind of market-related things. And the third thing I'll add is that when restaurants and employees go from one restaurant to another, it's a great source of referrals for us. Because they'll be at one restaurant, they'll see how much easier it is when you have these things integrated, how much better customer experience is. They'll go to another restaurant that doesn't have these things integrated. They're like, why aren't you guys using Cali? Like this is what we get the last restaurant. It's, you know, it's, it's, it's, it provides a much better experience. It's got cost-saving, scholarly, great things in it. And that's actually been a way for us to get more restaurants on board. Wow, that makes a lot of sense and congratulations. I think it also speaks to just the ease and usability of what you've been able to, to create. You know, we talked about like the push for loyalty. We talked a little bit about how it's difficult to sort of get the buy-in of older generations. But we've got people particularly like, you know, the millennials, the Gen Z coming up, who are all about the tech, who are all about ease and personalization, is Charlie able to make that the ordering experience even more personal for the people who are, you know, making these orders. Like I'm thinking about things. One of the reasons that I am resistant to things like Eureats or Grubhub is the ecological component. And so for example, a lot of times if I do call on this side to have delivery, I'll be like, don't worry about, you know, the plastic forks or the napkins or I don't need the ketchup packets or whatever it might be. Are these kind of components that we're trying to integrate as well? And I guess in the flip side, alternatives release even dollar savings because I don't have to spend money on a plastic fork for that order. Thank you. Yeah. No, definitely. I mean, the third parties have continually made progress on these types of issues, right? So there was a big push, I think this was two or three years ago, where all the third parties started, you know, making sure to provide that information. So every time you check out on Grubhub or Uber, there would be a checkbox that says, I don't need, you know, utensils napkins, blah, blah, blah, I have these things at home. This allowed, you know, the restaurant to have cost savings, like you said, this allowed for, you know, less traction of the landfills. And so what's really cool is that as soon as, you know, those third parties, you know, start pushing for that, we can very quickly get that information translated to the restaurant. And we can work with the different systems that exist in the restaurant to make sure that that information is communicated correctly. Some systems don't really have a spot where you can put that. So we can work with them to basically create an item on whether to include those utensils or we can put it in special notes section or we can create, you know, an open item kind of a dummy item where we can then add a comments and please don't include utensils napkins, etc. And so there's always a lot of opportunities for us to make sure that the goodwill and the good ideas from these companies actually gets executed because we're the ones that are working with restaurants to make sure operationally they're fulfilling all these different requests. Yeah. The operational component is the curious ones too. Like, have you seen in terms of how much less mistakes in ordering and fulfilling orders are happening, you know, like duplicate orders or, you know, putting the toppings on the burger when you weren't supposed to and things like that in terms of like customer satisfaction and just ease of stress and the people who are preparing the food as well. Yeah. I mean, that's a huge selling point. I mean, you're relying on manual data entry if you're not using integration. And if you're entering a hundred orders a day, you're going to have 95% accuracy. You know, that's like AA plus like that you think you're doing well. That's five orders a day though where you might misamodify or you might miss an item completely. You might choose the wrong one. You might not want to type out that comment. You could even miss out on allergy information. And so when this is programmatic, when it's automated, there's a one-to-one relationship. If this person put this in on Grubhump, it is getting to the restaurant. It is getting to the staff. And that's going to really cut down on those errors and provide a much better customer experience for sure. Yes. I have a, I have these nightmares when I used to work in this restaurant. And I remember that we had an app. This was during the pandemic. They were beginning of the pandemic. And we have the app. And it was a nightmare because the my boss, he thought that well with technology will be faster. Everything will be faster. But he didn't know that it was like there was no control with the orders that we were getting via the app and the people that we had in front. So if he thought that it would be faster, but not. So what would you recommend to those bosses, that they think that with technology, everything will be fixed. There must be a change. But I don't know, what can you share? Sure. Yeah. It's almost to be careful what you wish for. So restaurant choices, I need more orders, I need to generate more sales, gets on the app. Now I use too many sales, right? And that's going to make it harder for the staff to be able to put these out. It's going to make it more difficult to balance between our digital customers and our in-person customers. And I think that this comes down to, I think more of a baseline business model tactics. As a business, you have to project how much demand you're going to get. And then you also have to look at how much labor do I have, how much inventory do I have, how can I do on timing? Can I handle, you know, I can handle 20 orders an hour, I can handle 40, what about 60, what about 100, what about 200. And so there's a restaurant tours have been really good at this. And in the past, they typically do this around events. They know that when the super bowl is happening, they're going to get a ton of takeout, especially if you're a pizza in wings place. And there's, you know, if you're Valentine's Day, Valentine's Day, you're going to be getting a lot of reservations if you're a fine dining restaurant. And so restaurants tours are used to being able to balance changes in volume. It's just now everything's digital, right? It's a new medium that they have to make sure that they're keeping an eye out for. And so making sure that they're keeping eye for how many orders they're going to get, making sure that their staff appropriately, make sure their quote times are up to date, right? If I'm really busy, I'm not going to be able to get this order out in 30 minutes like I usually can. Let's make sure that we update that quote time to 60 minutes. I know I'm going to be busy at dinner time. Let's preset that. And Charlie has tools to help with these types of things as well. But as a restaurant tour, you've got to be aware of the volume. And you've got to be looking at all the different metrics that you look at for the rest of your which I think is something we haven't even touched on yet with Charlie. And that's like the data component what you're just saying. And being able to set and adjust. So we're, I'm guessing that you're able to spit out some of this data and metrics for the restaurant tour so then they're able to go in and then adjust and make adjustments and and actually be a lot more agile and lot more flexible. And I think the reliability of it that's not just going with my gut of maybe what has happened but what is happening and how has that played out? No, it's been it's been helpful. We actually released a whole slew of reporting tools this year. And it's been helpful for restaurants to look at them for a number of different reasons which are my items are are are doing the best right? What are my top 10? What you know what time is the day? Am I doing the most orders? What are my orders per hour? Do my off-premise orders like in my busiest on my off-premise? Does that also match where I'm busiest on my own? We can also you know some restaurants have different prices on different platforms. And so you can even tell a restaurant what are what's our average price point for this particular item? You know are we selling more at a higher price point to help them basically optimize their menus? And so the data components huge and there are an endless amount of use cases on how you can use that data to make your restaurant and your off-premise business much more efficient. Of course this is not just about the streamlined point of sale it's like hey I can better staff my place and avoid headaches and nightmares like America was referring to. So um Valentine's Day so let's talk about these this boss component we're at the final few minutes of our show so Sterling I do want to put you on the spot bringing it back a bit to the the co-founder boss idea and the Charlie origin story you know what were some kind of early wins for you? What helped you sort of gain momentum and how has this ultimately impacted the culture that you and your team are building? Yeah I can go a lot a lot of directions with that with that question. I think that there were two things early on in Charlie's journey that were instrumental car success. One was the kind of just the entrepreneurial spirit of following the problem right because everybody walks in to a particular situation and they have these preconceived notions on how they would solve the problem or what the problem truly is and a lot of times entrepreneurs will then fill that product but that's actually a really big mistake because what the entrepreneurs really should be doing is obsessing and you know hammering these customers with questions because what we found out when we were talking to restaurants right I built the mobile ordering app right this was people in bars to basically order drinks on their phone and have it be brought to their table and when I talk to restaurants they kept saying you have to integrate into the point of sale this has to integrate into the point of sale. So what I realized is that the problem that they had wasn't going to be solved by the app the problem that they were really having was just getting data into their point of sale system that's what let us even start Charlie then once we started Charlie it was really understanding all right why is this so hard like I understand what you want and if you dig and dig you'll find these underlying problems and when if you follow the problems that's how you can actually really build the best products our products and our features are not dictated by by what you know me or my co-founders or our engineers or product people think we should build our product is built by what customers tell us customers tell us like this is what I need this is my problem like this is what I'm struggling with and then it's on the entrepreneur to basically try to figure out how to solve those problems sometimes a very non-obvious ways and and that was really key for us it was following the problem it wasn't necessarily like shoving a solution at restaurants it was constantly asking them what their struggles were and what their challenges were and then offering and testing solutions to make sure that they worked and I think that was really a big part and I think the second part there was just having happy customers one of our earliest customers for anyone who's from the Chicago area you know let us entertain you very very successful restaurant group in Chicago they have a slew of different brands that have gone on to to be really big and they were early client of ours and it was really understood they taught us a lot about the restaurant industry and helped really impact and make sure the product that we were building was successful and then since they were so happy you can go at other restaurants and maybe like well it's good enough for let us entertain you like it's it's probably good enough for us and so really focusing on those early clients and making sure that they're so happy that they want to refer others and making sure that you're following problems and making I think we're two just absolutely key steps in the early days for us to be successful it's super interesting and I just I think the final question I have for you and then bring it back to this idea of listening to your customers and in a lot of ways it sounds like your customers take a mentorship role even if it's unintentional right not intentionally but they're mentoring you to be a better entrepreneur to be and build a better product and I know that mentorship is something that's incredibly important to you Sterling personal level I think as what have you received I think the best advice you received from a mentor and maybe how have that's played out in your life as well and how do you pass the torch you know how are you how do you say that to be a better mentor yourself I think yeah man I don't know if I could pick the best of piece advice I've gotten a lot of amazing amazing advice over the year I think that one of the things that I did that was this personally helped me my career and has certainly helped on Charlie is finding mentors not just one but multiple I mean like my dad's been a mentor to me my entire life but then when I you know started my you know careers in actuary you know I had a manager who was a mentor of mine and then I was able to find someone on the sales side who helped mentor me and then I was able to find someone you know that was a friend of a friend's uncle who started a company and so you know he mentored me for a little bit and all these things are sometimes are formal sometimes are informal but you just hop on the phone you ask questions you listen to you know these people you respect and then you start putting some of the things they say in action and you start seeing really great results it just turned into this like I just craved mentorship and what I found is that so many people want to help and they want to give advice and they want to help you solve problems and they want to give this guidance and so now you know 10 years removed from a lot of this I see a lot of young entrepreneurs especially the restaurant tech space starting up and I always you know take the opportunity you know I love talking to entrepreneurs in the space I talk to them every week multiple times so that I can pay it back because I had a bunch of people who gave me their time and great advice and didn't ask for anything in return and so I'm forever indebted to those people in the space and the thing that I can do is try to do the same for you know for the next little young entrepreneurs and try to pass on some of the same things that I learned for sure I think what I'm hearing is be willing to help and be willing to receive help which I think is is sometimes easier said than done for sure well certainly we're actually at the end of our show today if you can believe it or not it's been a powerful afternoon or afternoon morning half an hour of learning from you learning all about Charlie and how you're making restaurant tech easier and growing and we look forward to seeing you continue down this successful journey thank you very much thanks for having me this was fun thank you we'll say stick around for just a minute before as we go off air but before we do we would like to introduce tomorrow show yes tomorrow we're going to have our second episode of our AWS segment which and the topic is going to be about the getaway drug to the cloud and the question is the tagline how can the containerization did I say that correctly Jim containerization yes containers the gateway drug to the cloud yeah yeah you're ready using be amped up with the cloud that is the question and the guests are going to be our chance senior partner solutions architect at amazon web services and Gustavo Romero principal DevOps engineering at Tincora tomorrow at 10 a.m. Pacific that's right well thank you thank you again Sterling everyone have a great rest of your day we'll see you tomorrow at 10 a.m. Pacific bye for now\n"

And most restaurant tours, this isn't something that they grew up with. You know, they got into starting a restaurant because of hospitality. They got into it because they wanted to make great food, provide a great experience. And so adopting this new technology can be really daunting, especially for the small and mid-size restaurants who don't have big IT groups or large marketing budgets. And so what Charlie really strives to do is make sure that same tech that is powering large thousand location national chains is accessible and available so that your small mom and pop restaurants that we love so much in our neighborhoods can be just as successful and have the same type of interactions with consumers.

I mean, you can, if you look at, you know, a lot of things that were happening in 2019, the year before the pandemic, you were seeing companies like Drodash and Uber Eats, you know, explode, right? You were seeing, I think, over $4 billion of venture capital being poured into restaurant technology companies. It was still happening. And it was actually happening at a pretty quick rate. What we saw in COVID was, you know, a very drastic, drastic acceleration to, you know, instead of moving quickly and going through all these restaurants, it was in a matter of weeks, every restaurant needed to use it, because it was the only way they could save business.

Restaurants are now having to do the same thing and they have to figure out how much do I invest in this channel, my direct one, how much do I invest in third parties, how much do I invest in, you know, in Instagram and all these different things. And so it's becoming much more complicated for restaurants, specifically because of that customer loyalty point that you bring up. It's probably able to help in terms of consultation, let's say, in terms of business models, where certain restaurants are at or even where they're located, pull their client faces, and offer ideas or even how to set up perhaps your own website. How is that working or is that maybe what's coming next? We ourselves were not a consulting shop. We're a technology company, but a lot of times we are where restaurants start on kind of their digital journey.

Yeah, for a restaurant to get onboarded with Charlie or with any technology, is actually one of the reasons that we exist in the first place, because what we found is that it was really hard for a restaurant to start. And so we think about why it was difficult and there's a number of deeply technical reasons on why getting started with some of these new technologies, so difficult. And we think about what the focus has always been on Charlie. And so when we've looked at onboarding restaurants, we basically took the existing model that we saw with every technology company that are restaurant and work with. And we're like, how do we do the opposite of that? How do we make it super, super easy? How do we make it so that a restaurant doesn't really think about it?

      " Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of Dojo Live this Wednesday, November 23rd, 2022. My name is Kim Lantis and it's my pleasure to be hosting along with America Guerrero today. Hello Kim, hello, Sigram. Sigram, right? Yes, Sigram, that's right. Hello, America. Hello, Sigram. We're so happy to have you on the show today. For those of you watching, Sigram is the CEO of Stockably joining us from South Africa. So good evening, Sigram. Yes, good evening. Perfect. You know, so today we're going to be talking about an interesting topic that's, you know, been quite trendy for the last few years and that is blockchain, but specifically how that relates to media copyright. Before we get into the details, however, we would love to get to know you a bit better, Sigram. Your story, your passions, what's led up to Stockably, so please share a bit about yourself with us. Thank you. Thanks, Tim. Well, I've been a creator for probably as long as I can remember. When I left high school, I thought, you know, what I'm going to, I'm going to do something creatively and so I thought, you know, what design, this is, this is it because here I get to make something from nothing. And so I decided I was going to become a designer and I spent about two years doing that and learning all the way. Definitely was one of those like, I didn't study for it at all. I just kind of thought I knew what I was doing. So I convinced someone that I knew what I was doing. And in my own, you did that for about two years. And that's when photography sort of started coming in. And this was something that I, as a kid, I was had dabbled with, but I never sort of realized like this was an actual career option. So that's why I thought design was the creative outlates. Anyway, and so I had a fantastic boss and he gave me an ultimatum and he said, you know, it's a dream you can either quit or I'm going to fire you, but you need to go and do your own thing. And it was kind of like the kick out of the nest that I needed at a tender age of 21. And that was when I decided I was going to try this photography thing that I thought also passionate about. You very quickly learn it is mostly business. And that's where, yeah, you sort of, the back shattered illusion gets broken and you realize it's mostly really about building a business. It's very list about taking photos and so much of it, before you even get to taking the photos part has to do with your business relationships, understanding demands and needs. Because I mean, if no one's going to hire you if they don't ever need for you. So it's sort of like you start learning really, really quickly on the ropes like you just decide on a niche. You can't just be jack-able trades because I mean, you know what, no one's going to hire a guy that says he can take photos of your dog and your wedding because well, what's it going to be? Good dog photo or good wedding photos. And that's kind of like where... Maybe where? If the dog is the best man. What happens? I am totally having my dog as my best man. I have four dogs. So they're going to have to fight for that role. So anyway, but that's sort of when I really sort of decided on me to look at what was what was my passion, where was I really passionate and where did I want to put my efforts? And that sort of, well, being a guy, you know what, I love cars. So I started taking photos of cars. And that kind of sort of like really, really quickly grew because when you're like doing something, you don't mind doing a lot of it. So you just kind of like doing this, but you loving what you're doing and you're learning on the job then. Once again, it's sort of like one of those things where you just the months sort of like go by really quickly. And that sort of just escalated and very soon I had my first magazine shoot, which I was so proud of. It was like... What was it? What was it? What was the car? Well, the car was nothing you had right ever but it was a modified car magazine called Max Power. And the car was... They did have something called a zero day cover where literally they don't have a cover to go to prints up until the day that magazine has to go to the princess. So they have this thing called a zero day cover where you have to come in, shoot something, deliver it on the same day. Which in editorial is a little bit extreme. Anyway, I got thrown into this. They were like, well, so you can see what you do. And I was like, you know, this is my mirror to shine. I dusted myself open and I did the best job I could. And looking back now, it's shocking. But you know what, that was my foray into the big wide world of editorial. And that magazine shut down two months later. Unfortunately, hopefully not because of the cover. But it was... There were there were... I'm nothing to do with that promise. But anyway, that was my foray into editorial. And I spent probably the next decade there and I absolutely loved editorial. It was really my proving brown for myself as a photographer because I really had to be able to produce things from very little. And that sort of transition is quite fluidly, then into commercial photography. And that's what I've been doing ever since. It's been traveling around the world and commercial ad campaigns for cars and brands. But at the global level, which has sort of been a really beautiful sort of like again, transition from the editorial. It's sort of like that step up into the next segment in the genre of what happens in an industry on a global level. And that's been where I've been and it's been incredibly, incredibly awesome journey and it's always an adventure. And I never know where I'm going to be in the world, which is also what I love so much about cars specifically is that it does take me commercially all over the world. They go, well, we want to shoot in, well, I guess not Russia anytime soon, but if you want to, we want to shoot in Russia. So we just go off to Russia or the middle of Spain or wherever. So that's been the journey up until to where I am. And it's sort of gave birth to stockably. Yes, so we're talking about media, editorial content, globality of it. So let's talk about stockably. Who are you? What is the problem yourself in as a company? So really the fact that I've been a creator sort of was the birthplace of why I was able to identify an issue that I want to do try and fix. And now is really like as I was doing these big commercial jobs, the licenses and the usage that went behind those jobs weren't always being recorded in a way that was sort of like the right sort of way. These records were just sort of somehow go very missing somewhere or someone that was in charge of looking after them, so it doesn't work at the agency anymore. And so really there was this not maliciously so, but just a logistical issue when it came to how usage and media was being recorded. That would just often not go recorded the way it needed to be done. So that's me as the creator could come back and go, well listen, this media usage has expired now. What is happening? Are we renewing the license? Are we seeing the license? Are we? What is being done with my media that are creating commercial that you are using for commercial gain? So really that's that. Which I think is just absolutely compounded in today's day and age with internet and like click, copy paste. Oh, I can't download it, so I'm just going to capture screenshot. And there are so many ways to get around what belongs to who and having your rightfully so your name attached to what is your creative property. Yeah, I can imagine. Because you think back of these kind of like iconic photos of maybe Marilyn Monroe or something and you can remember the photo. But yeah, who took it? We may or may not. And who owns the rights to those images really? I mean, well for those Marilyn ones, it's most probably getty because getty is a massive conglomerate in the in the rights management segment. So they do that and also they love archival stuff which is great because that's an example of trying to look after rights and management of usage. My agent actually also does the same thing with South African artists and content like that. He makes sure that it gets maintained and it's great to see it's really great that people do still care about this because really it's the people that sort of don't care about it that sort of create the problem. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. And I think this is a really great segue into today's topic actually. Yes, which is revolutionizing media copyright and ownership for a prosperous future on blockchain. And the question is how do we manage a global industry of media copyright and usage fairly? So could you please share with us like a high level about this industry about what's going on in the world? And then why did you choose this question? So on the high level at any point in time like right now in KTAM, there are probably five to ten different media productions going on. These could be commercials for Coca-Cola or any brand that has come to this country or it's a local brand, but there's this creation of the commercial project, a creative media project where in the end the consumer sees a TV commercial, a 50 second TV commercial. But behind that commercial are hundreds of people, teams and agencies and contracts. And there are so much logistics that go into media creation, especially on the commercial segments, because everything has to be above board. You have to, everyone has to be signed and represented. And there's even some unions also that come into play with that. So in the commercial sphere of creation, there's a lot of logistics and so many, so many moving parts. Now if you zoom out from that, there one production can have 100, 200 different copyright contracts and usage contracts that all go into every talent person that's in that commercial has an individual copyright and individual usage contract for that commercial. There are so many moving parts. So when you zoom out and you look at how many of these are being created, just in a city, you have absolutely thousands and then you zoom out and look at the content, a hundred of thousands, and then you look at it globally and it's absolutely millions. Now you take all these millions and there is no way yet that all of them are working coherently that you have an ecosystem where you can track all uses contracts around the world for any project with any sphere or any industry. So that's really what gave birth to the choice of how we want to do build. Is that we looked at, well, what are we building for? We're building for trying to create something that definitely doesn't exist now, but we would like to see it exist in the next five to ten years. And as far as how structure and record-keeping and the technology that's associated with that, blockchain really is that technology. So it's really it's not a, there's a saying about trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Choosing blockchain really was because of how we would like to future-proof the record-keeping and that structure, not because we think blockchain is the best thing or the only solution to the way of doing it. But it's just how we've decided to build it. And it's I think maybe of what it currently exists, one of the best options for it. And in five to ten years might be something else, but for now that's what we're working with. You know, the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of blockchain is cryptocurrency. Are you, when you're talking about this chain of rights, this chain of history and data, we're not talking about money, are we like what other type to me it's like it sounds probably silly, but like to utilize blockchain outside of something that is dollars is different to me. Like how does this function? Yeah, so really blockchain is just the structure that which is going to record all the records. But what's nice about it is that cryptocurrency, that lives natively on blockchain as well. So stuckably isn't based to be a cryptocurrency. Stuckably is just the company that is helping you keep all your records in place in an immutable way that is always accessible and it's intangible with, it will work cooperatively with all your platforms as you need to log into them. And then that does tie in as you mentioned with cryptocurrency is you can choose to have a cryptocurrency wallet with stuckably because we're living natively on blockchain. So that's a really future role we see it coming in as because we would love to be able to see transactions happening on the platform so that when you need to renew your contract instead of then having to still in real life go and say, hey listen, your contract has expired, please pay me again for it and you make your invoice and you wait for them to pay you, we could all just happen used have that happening instantaneously on the stuckably platform. And that's sort of really that future proofing that we're coming into is that everyone can have an identity, their identity unstuckably as a creator, as a production, as an agency. And when all of that talks to each other beautifully, when it comes to your seeing who own something, it's all there because all the associated with your identity on blockchain. So but that's sort of maybe more the I think the the guys that are really into blockchain sort of like that sort of talk, but really that's that's the next five years when people are much more at sort of a depth familiar with what blockchain and cryptocurrency is going to do in our modern world. So yeah. And it makes a lot of sense because I mean you're talking with something that's immutable, but I'm also curious because contracts well they're valid are immutable, but then they can change. So it's not like we're going back to previous blocks of updates, something we're just adding a new block to the chain and then this makes things much easier faster. Well you have you have the record being updated instantaneously and it's associated with really cool things like smart contracts which then can do things, they're really they functional, their utility. It's not so much the value of now that contracting renewed because that value was tied into a monetary value because it's a real world contract. It's not some just I mean it does it does live in the real world, but the record keeping the ultimately the one that's going to live forever behind behind the paper trail is the one that lives on stuckably. So that's the one that is always going to be the master file. So that no one can ever come back and say hey that contract wasn't filed at that stage. You can say well unfortunately not the records are what they are. So it takes a lot of that gray area out of it and that's sort of what I've experienced as that pain point coming back to me as a creator. What I experienced over the years is that when I went back and said hey listen that contract has expired we need to renew that contract we need to continue using my piece of media. They go okay well we can't find the records so well what do we do now and what can I do and it's a way to a way human error. Exactly and it's not always malicious and like it's not like people are there and like trying to swindle people out of contracts and rightly so usage rights that belong to them. It really it sort of goes out of mind out of out of place out of mind so it's that that we're trying to fool that gap. We're trying to bring in something it takes out the human error but also that takes out the friction of getting those contracts renewed. So as a creator I want you to pay me again much quicker if that's a frictionless experience. If I can say click this button and you've repaid me that's it. He would that's a much frictionless way to go about as a creator getting my client to renew their contracts with me then saying okay well I now need another purchase order from your agency and then when I get it I've to put on my invoice and then I send my invoice to you and then it goes your accounts department then it's with them for 30 days and then I have to waste another 60 before I get my money out. This is how the real world is still currently operating but this is sort of like where as we sort of go forward and people understand what cryptocurrency and how it can be linked to native stable tokens that's how we want to be paid in the future. I don't want to have to have this insane long paper trail before I can get paid and also that's where the sort of prosperity aspect comes in is that I can now start renewing my media at a much faster rate than having to manually sit and do that. It's just it's a lot of it's a lot of human human work that's currently happening there which is a completely unnecessary. And then I think I imagine that gets amplified when you're talking about this on the global scale in terms of having to exchange rates like where you live versus where the business is taking place. I don't know. Yeah I mean so many in the States has a building filled with six levels of lawyers and their job is just a new usage contracts. I mean that is a lot of man hours going into something that really could be a lot of easier process. I mean look I know there's there's laws and regulations and every country has theirs. But what's beautiful about Stuckbli is that you don't need to use the contracts that Stuckbli uses. We just give you the place to put your contracts. So those contracts still remain the IP or whoever put those together because there's a lot of there's a lot of IP and work that goes into every corporate contracts that they put into place. They don't want that shared with their competitors. So again we're not it's sort of like a very fluid system. I'm curious how this work for example I'm an artist who wants to protect my designs or I don't know. So I have this technology that's helping me to record to the keep track of it with the contracts. And you mentioned that there are different kind of regulations out there in the world. So do you provide this kind of consulting services where you for example I'm someone who wants to promote something I'm just thinking out that in China for example. No that's that's a great question. So you know what eventually eventually we probably will because that me as a creator I very much have the creators welding at heart. And I think that's also why being the CEO of the company has sort of it makes it feel good that what I'm creating is for a global economy of creators because I've got your well being at heart because I have been there and still am there. I absolutely love what I do. So that consulting service I'm pretty sure at some point yes we would love to offer something like that to help create and sort of understand how you can use technology to reserve your copyrights and but still in a way that's sort of better than what's been available in a way that every time an artwork is sold whether it's in real life or it's the digital artwork is what a lot of people forget about is that. NFT is very much everyone says oh what's a JPEG of a monkey really worth but NFT is really the the opposite. Well they suppose it's like anything it's worth what you say it's worth. Exactly but also it's what it's linked to it's what that's what that contract says I owe you for owning this thing. I think what was so great was Gary Vee I mean he's such an advocate for NFTs and he really is a bullet bullet at the horns worth it and I absolutely love his enthusiasm but he was the first one that really sort of helped people understand that because he's an FTs with sketches hand drawn sketches it was like Rudolph the reindeer whatever and it was this hand drawn sketch but that was the NFT but what he well and sort of helped people understand was that was your ticket into my conferences this got you a 15 minute breakfast with me which is exclusive as hell because I mean everyone once they time with Gary Vee and sort of that helped people understand that it's not the NFT it's not the actual image or that that's really the value it's what it represents and that's really how again as artists we can go well either this digital file is the value this is my creation and once you buy it you own the rights to that and I have I'm agreeing that you now own the rights that and it's a one of one I can never use that again that's actually that contract that has just happened when you buying NFT I think artists themselves sort of like need to just sort of be aware of that that you can't just be selling that same NFT as a one of one so just a whole lot of people because essentially you're breaking your own contract as a creator so really the willy-wanker golden ticket yes it's it's it really it has it has to live and abide by that because really that's that's what the contract is so in the commercial world really these contracts are a little bit more common we understand that as a model as an artist as a music artist that if I license my music to you as Sony or whatever to use it in a movie I know for as long as that movie is playing I'm getting my contract from that everyone completely understands that but when it comes to sort of the more graphic artists the the painters the photographers the videographers the the the more creative side then that goes out the window they go well why should we pay you that we're just using your media and suddenly this is also that that fights that's we that's I'm sort of certainly passionate about being a creator is that I people need to understand that there is a commercial value that's being derived from something and that means that person must be compensated just because you're a famous musician doesn't make it right and if you're a photographer it makes it wrong so yeah so famous musician and a not famous musician yes that actually have a question related to that so this is an investment that you need to do to protect your work for but for example artists that are beginning this journey how is this accessible how accessible is this for those kind of artists well with stuck of Lee specifically the artist onboarding artists is part of our second phase of our build because we're still we're still building and developing so the second phase really is where we bring once we have all the agencies and those and those entities that utilize the media then we bring the creatives then we're going well now you have a platform that you can directly sell your media to these agents that are the ones that are licensing media so it's sort of we're going about them in a different way as well as instead of saying to the creators well give us your media and we'll try sell it for you we're first actually building a company that serves the media industry and then going well hey let's slot in creators underneath this with the same beautiful system with licensing and and being able to track that licensing and making sure that artist is paid under that beautifully so yeah that's definitely part of the second phase of of how we want to bring creators into especially the commercializing of media I think that the stock library media has definitely cheapens what people perceive media to be they go well why why should I buy your image for a thousand dollars if I can get it off stock for one dollar but the difference is if you're using it for commercial gain and commercial media usage and I you want my piece of media well the price is what I say it is and being the owner this is the power that you have so yeah it's it's sort of helping the artists sort of like not take their power back but helping them see that that really they they don't need to always take the raw end of the deal but having a platform that ensures that they get paid pay it's one of the first steps in making that happen yeah I think it certainly is in terms of like the media companies I suppose the agencies how how large or like what's your client base is this smaller agencies is this the sonies of the world like it how is that kind of balancing things out as well in terms of I'm an agent but I don't have six floors of people lawyers working for me right so yeah stock of me so you don't exactly so let's talk about how that's not just for the artists themselves and the creators but also the people who are you know distributed in this and creating how does that level the playing field so to speak so really the the question is how do we make how do we make your life easier and on the the B2B segment of that is really as the agencies and the production companies than the model agencies the all the all the moving parts that go into commercial media production have the same issue is that they they need to be putting in these man hours to keep these records updated or at least they should be they're not which is the caveat to that so really the question how do we make that easier for them so at the moment we we in in talks with a lot of the productions and we're going to them and saying well what are your issues what are your problems how what are you struggling with in the early stages of coming together with stockably and and also with my business partners and and path that's here with me in k town we we really sort of like had this idea that we wanted to run with but then sort of like as I as we sort of flesh this out and sort of building this out and realize that you have to talk to your market first you can't just run headlong and build something that you think your market once because then you're like two years into a build and a million dollars into dev costs and and you've built something that no one really wants so again me being a creative is I was able to go back to my industry because these production companies and its ad agencies these are the people have been working with for the last decade so really the end there was it was neutral friends already so I could go in with them and talk to them and just be like how are you dealing with xyz what are you struggling with and they would just talk very freely because I was something that they've worked with so that was really and also I wasn't it wasn't co it's I was very up front that I'm trying to build something to make their lives easier and then of course when you ask someone how can you make your life easier then the flood gets open in there and everyone loves to talk about problems and that's when you really you shut up and you sit back and you just like them down and then you talk to the next agency and you talk to the next person and at the end of the week you've got a hundred things that people are struggling with things that they hate and you really then just whittle that down you go well what can we address how can we group these together and that's sort of like how you start refining your your focus as a company because in the in the beginning we sort of were very broad we were just sort of like thinking blockchain and and NFTs were all the hacks so how do we bring that in and then how do we bring an artist and it was very all over the place and it really it took talking to the markets you sort of understand well how do we narrow this down how do we really build something that is actually a viable product not something that we think people are going to want because honestly if we're done that we're built completely the wrong thing so and that's and it's a continual process I mean we still talking to them as we go we'll show them this and go so what do you think of this how do you enjoy this and then they give you feedback and your iterates and so yeah so we we're really fortunate to sort of like have gotten to that step quite early on as a company I think listening to the YC community and and all the incredible channels that are on YouTube you learn a lot it's sort of really and talking to investors we've been talking to investors for for a few months and also it's opened your eyes as to what's happening globally and of course y'all at the moment right now is in November 2022 it is probably the worst time in the world to do any sort of fundraising yeah the fundraising blockchain crypto crypto but you know what but that's the great thing is that we're not really sort of dependent on what that happening there in a in a in a commercial sense because we're still building for a real world problem solved so it's like you know cryptocurrency could drop to zero but that's great we still have blockchain we're still building on the structure the immutability and consistency which is beautiful and I really appreciate it you know we're going to ask you about your words of wisdom and your company culture and I think you already naturally touched on that in terms of just your ability to foresee and and speak to the market pivot even if even if it wasn't along with your original idea which actually reminds me of a show we had in Bibi last week with trusty care Joseph Schneider he he was mentioning how kind of like you like you start with this idea of how can I help the artist and his initial ideas how can I help patients you know get through tough times with health insurers but realizing that I actually have to go the best place to start is with insurers themselves and in your case the best place to start is with the agencies themselves because with the insurers with the agencies therefore the patients and the the artists are going to follow right and so even though it's a different path perhaps I think the end result is is ultimately what you what you're looking for and what you're wanting no I mean I I care about my industry and and I work in my industry at a global level so it's like it would be very sort of never mind it to just think well how do I do this for the South African market or for Cape Town it really it's something that I I can really sort of bite into and it's one of the reasons why it's been it's one of the the passions behind biting into the project and taking it on as CEO was the fact that it's so closely tied with a passion of mine of this industry and you know it's it's I could carry on the rest of my life trying to create a brand called Seagrim Pierce but this is something that I could actually do to you know it not change the world but definitely help shape it and just sort of like tighten it up a little bit and just help it in a direction that myself as an artist if I could I imagine I deals media industry that I want to work in that's the one I want to work in one that sort of that he's very fair and accurate and so yeah it's a great burn to to bite into so and it's I think it's super timely to particularly with what's happening in the world at large there are more and more creators happening we have this freedom and the technology and the building for us to use and create and so it's it's not going anywhere that's for sure I mean we're shifting to more and more of I think a a knowledge worker creator worker environment and it definitely makes sense well Seagrim we've come to the end of our half hour today if you can believe it thank you so much for sharing your time your experience your knowledge and about stockably with us and just a whole new perspective on what how blockchain can actually be used for me it was very enlightening say thank you thank you wish you and stockably nothing but success hang on just one moment before we go out there before we do we'd like to remind our viewers that there's no show tomorrow we usually do have Thursday shows but tomorrow is thanks giving so happy Thanksgiving yes safe travels good food hopefully doesn't get too intense intense or around the the family table but but do join us next week next week is a full week we're going to have our recap show at Tana Park Pacific and then on Tuesday we'll be speaking with a kill goop of no broker Wednesday will be followed up with another the segment three of four of our Amazon Web Services segment with art Chan and we're wrap up the week with intelligence node and Sanjeev Soeria on Thursday so join us all next week Tana Park Pacific right here on doja live thank you again sir tomorrow\n"

      " Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of Dojo Live this Tuesday, November 8th, 2022. My name is Kim Lantis and it's my pleasure to be hosting a long with America Guerrero. Hello everybody, hello Jaya, Jaya, Kishore, ready? Jaya and Kishore, we're going to be calling you Kishore today and for your request. We're so happy to have you on our show, CoFounder and CTO of Yellow AI joining us all the way from Abu Dhabi 10 PM. So Kishore, you are a trooper. Thank you so much. Hey, thank you. Kim, thanks America. Thank you for having me here today. It's going to be a great conversation. We already got to banter a bit pre-show and I know you have quite the story to tell. So before we move on specifically to Yellow AI and more specifically conversational AI, we'd like to get to know you a bit better Kishore. If you could please just share a bit of your story, your passion and sort of what's led up to Yellow. Thank you. Awesome. Yeah, that's definitely a nice story to talk about. So hey, hey everyone, I'm Kishore. I am other co-founders and CTO for Yellow AI. I am from Hyderabad, India in southern India and I've graduated in 2009, Computer Science. And yeah, I've always loved building software products which actually changes, you know, real world problems or solved real world problems always fascinated by software products. And I started working in 2009, 10 in startups and I've also worked in enterprise companies, worked on enterprise software. I've also worked in e-commerce companies. So there's a diverse experience I had throughout my career. But I always wanted to start my own company because I get to choose what kind of problems I'm going to solve. So in around 2014, I started one of the co-founder, Ragu and Raksit, the CTO co-founders. So we started in 2015 on solving the very unique problem of the kind of connecting businesses and users over chat or messaging. So in 2015, WhatsApp, especially in emerging markets like India and Southeast Asia and messaging was a huge thing. Everybody was on WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger and stuff like that. So very interesting to know is that even our grandparents used to, the first time they have never exposed to computers and first time they've been exposed to the mobile. So they started, they understand messaging that anything else. So we thought of solving that problem of like why can't they have the similar experience when they converse with businesses. So that's when we started off. Journey. And then here, now in seven years later, we have customers across 35 plus countries, 1000 plus enterprise companies working with us, and 800 plus employees across the globe, distributed primarily in India. And they are growing at rapid pace. Sure, sounds like 800 plus employees, 100 plus enterprise companies in 70, something like that. 1000 plus in 35 plus countries. Yes, yes, this is crazy, especially in the span of just eight years. So let's talk specifically. And I think it makes a lot of sense, right, with messaging, feeling, I think a lot more intuitive. It's simplified. One of the more simple things that we're able to do on our cell phones and via other platforms. So what is it exactly that yellow AI is doing? Like, who are you? And what's the problem that you're solving? Absolutely. So think about, so what we do is essentially automate customer support and sell for enterprise companies like Indigo Airlines, Domino, Sephora, with varied industry types. So basically, we basically automate customer support predominantly. Think about a use case where you have to call up airlines to cancel a ticket. I'm sure everybody has all of us have gone through that pain of canceling a ticket on airlines waiting for like hours on calls. And then, you know, still not getting to a conclusion there. So, yeah, in my particular case, I remember once I literally, in blesses his heart, I was put through to an agent and I could not understand. I physically could not understand what it was that he was telling me. And I remember asking a couple times, you know, very a project. I'm sorry. Like, I'm struggling to understand what you're saying. Could you please put transfer me to someone else and that transfer never to place? I literally had to hang up and just call back in and start from from from zero. And yeah. It's interesting. So this one plus one trillion dollar plus spend specifically on customer support to improve the customer experience for the end users. But then that was truly innocent with a team. Yeah. A trillion dollars every year. It's every year. It's spent on customer support. And a one percent of the users are happy with the customer support they get. So, that's the that kind of, you know, that so that's the main problem that we are we solve. So we automate the majority of the support that customers get with this from these enterprises. So imagine you call up an airline to cancel the ticket. What if it's just, you know, I need to cancel the ticket or you call up and just say, I need to cancel my ticket rather than waiting for an agent. You can just you pick up the phone and say, I need to cancel the ticket. Yeah, it's done in like a few seconds. So that's that's the experience that we provide as as as you know, yeah. Wow. And it seems so simple on the face of it. Like I message you, this is me, I can confirm that this is me cancel my ticket and then they say cancel. But the back. Yeah. What's happening on the back end? Yeah, that I would have yes. So, incredibly complex. Yes, yes, yes. I think yeah, we, it's I would have oversimplified what it looks like as you know, the term conversationally AI. But we all are like fascinated by chatbots, right? You know, when we've seen sci-fi movies and, you know, computer talking to a human is always fascinating. So, right, I think it's no, it's the idea has been there always there for like decades. But then it has picked up over the last five to ten years because the advancements in ML specifically and the compute right to to process that kind of a data in the last five to ten years getting this GPUs and machine learning models and so that's when it started picking up and then we started seeing more real world use cases being solved by chatbots. So, that's when the word conversationally AI is also a coin and you know, when that when the social channels started opening up their platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook where you can actually build on the top of these messaging platforms and then provide customer support or sales or any other use case of that matter. It's happening. You know, you mentioned just one percent of people traditionally being satisfied with their custom experience. How has this increased, you know, with your experience in the conversational AI is there an increase in that like what percentage, how does that compare? So, I have some stats around that. I know 77% of the customers, they feel that you know, chatbots they would prefer to talk to a bot rather than a human because they get stuff answered pretty fast and in particularly because rather than waiting for long hours, right, we have seen that in that and that trend is more with millennials, right, they often they talk to they don't want to cons work with an agent and wait for a long time. And also, there is a 70% drop in the, you know, in the cost equation. So, basically there's a 70% reduction in the cost for enterprises where they don't have to have as many agents supporting the customers. It's both it's been when right, you are able to reduce the support cost at the same time you are able to increase the engagement or you know, improve the satisfaction for your users. So, that's a, I have a question. Yes. Yes. You mentioned that you can also utilize conversational AI on your company with sales. Am I right? Did you say that? Yes. Yes. How does it work exactly with the AI component? Because I remember we had a show, I don't remember the name of the guest right now, but basically the conversation was that mobile messaging is now a big boom and you can utilize this new channel because it's not that common out there. And sending the sales. Yes. Requests via message. Yes. Yes. So, imagine like you, so I, and it's all after eight years, it's all coming together. I felt like it's all coming together when I recently I was traveling to Bangalore and I booked my flight ticket on a chat port which are chat port on Indigo Airlines. And then I booked my ticket and after sometime I've booked my hotel through Taj hotels, chat port again powered by a low AI. And then after, you know, I took my travel insurance on Pajaj General Insurance website and it's all on our board. And then when I, you know, I did my web check in on Indigo bot. It's all, it's all, it was all seamless and it felt like, you know, it covered customer support to, you know, sales because where I'm buying the ticket on, on the bot itself. So, I need to book a ticket from Bangalore, Abu Dhabi to Bangalore. And it gives me your options. I just go click and then I buy it. So, this is the sales use case. I want that if I have to book an appointment with the dentist, I just go, you know, I need a book and appointment at 4 p.m. tomorrow with the dentist. So, it's as simple as that. So, that's the, I, you know, from sales use cases to e-commerce use cases and support. So, all of it can be enabled through conversation lia. I'm curious when you talk about these types of transactions. I speak for myself when I'm, I'm very much, I like to be in, in control. I suppose I like to be able to see all the options that are available to me. I'm the type of person who will read through reviews and, you know, check things and I like to price check. What would this type of interaction look like conversationally with, with a chat bot? Am I still able to have all of these options available to me or does it streamline them for me? Like, this is my price, that's too expensive. I need something cheaper or what does that look like? Yeah. So, that's, so that's the evolution of the chat. Honestly, I'm going to be right. So, what it was like when it started versus, you know, what it is going to be in the future. So, when for now, so basically, the complex interaction between a human, it might not be able to enable as personalized or as complex information or complex interaction. But a lot of repetitive things are like, you know, some things with us which is context aware or connecting to the history of the you know, interaction that you had with the business before. So, combining all those and then, you know, personalizing to some aspect of it is going to be possible today. But a lot more, you know, more empathized conversations with as a human is still not possible with conversation layer. That's the future aspect of like how it is going to evolve in the coming years. And now, even enabling the agents to have a better interaction with the customers is also conversation layer. So, how does conversation layer enable the agents who are sitting in the back end who are talking to the customer? So, they how they get assisted with the conversation layer that itself is also a big step up in terms of customer experience. Wow. Like, like QAIN and tipping me off in terms of, I don't know, bringing our cancellation policy to my fingertips so that I can read through it. Yeah, they just quickly ask about it, just brings up and, you know, get while the customer is on the call, he does stuff pretty quickly rather than searching over like multiple systems. Right. So, just to add a complexity there for the agent, right? What if the agent doesn't know the language that the end customer is conversing in? So, the moment that goes into what if we have a chatbot which just translates what's happening with the user and then what will be conversing with the end user but then the agent can actually type in there with in their language and then it gets translated and then spoken on the call over the call in real time. That's again the future of conversation. That's the future. Yeah, call this lii. Wow, all of them that have working, I think I guess, to develop. That's absolutely fascinating. And I think you brought up a really great point, something that, you know, up until now we've really been talking about how conversational AI is transforming the customer's experience but then also how that's transforming the agent's experience, you know, in terms of just work environment, you know, in terms of efficiency for the enterprise itself. So, I can see why this is of course appealing to me as a customer and saving my time, my effort, energy and those types of things. Let's talk about that flip side then. Like, what are some of the advantages to the enterprises who are choosing to utilize the conversational AI path in their customer experience? So, we talked about customer experience in general, how it is. So, for enterprises, it's the cost, they're going to reduce the cost much better customer satisfaction. And there's another aspect of a conversation lii which is not end user facing, its employee experience and then productivity. So, that's another important aspect where conversation lii solves. So, I imagine I just need to take a couple of days leave, right. In the current world, you just have to, you have to actually bring up the systems that there's a leave management system, you have to bring it up and you have to create a request and you have to send it submit a request and you might not know when the leave request is going to get approved or you just need to just search for some policies, right. You know, what is the leave policy or what is the maternity policy or, you know, what in general, there are so many questions that or I just need to raise a reimbursement request. And there are multiple systems and what is one system to do all of these. There are multiple systems for employee in an enterprise. So, we might, with the thousand people or the energy people company, we have so many systems to navigate through for every single thing. So, we have employee experience, but as a, you know, basically, you can build multiple use cases on the platform. It can be employee use cases or an user use cases. So, you can, it connects with multiple systems in the back end and you will be able to do all these different day-to-day things that, you know, that you don't have to interact with like 10 systems or like 15 systems, you just interact with one bot out there. Hey, hey, me, I need to, you know, apply for a leave and then it just goes and it creates a request and manager gets, hey, this guy wants to apply for a leave on so and so day, do you want to approve it? Yes, I want to approve it. Then they're in there itself on their, the stop. So, it's, it's so seamless and the productivity increases like tremendous there. Wow, yeah, that's fascinating. And I think you bring up my next question. Is that, and that's the ability to sort of personalize what's happening? I like to talk about sort of, I don't know, the interface of what yellow, yellow AI has built out. I mean, if you've got, I think you named a couple, you, I think you mentioned Domino's Sephora. I don't, I think you named it to one or two other companies that are utilizing your service. Obviously, Domino's pizza and Sephora are quite distinct verticals, different markets. Yes, yes, yes. How are you able to quote unquote teach what needs to be asked or just the, anticipate the types of conversations that are going to be happening via these chatbots. I mean, talking about foundation colors and pepperoni are, you know, completely different vocabularies. How do you anticipate that? What does it look like in terms of studying things up and then growing with the information that's, that's then in the interactions that are then happening? So, let me answer that question in like multiple stages. So, how conversationally, when we started off, so there were bunch of customers who wanted to reduce their support costs and also increased their revenue by being available on these new wage messaging channels for their end users. So, they should be able to, so there, that is a BFF, it's a BFFS I customer, initial customers of us and insurance companies, they wanted to reduce support costs and they wanted to be available on messaging channels. That was the use case. And we started building out, started coding those use cases as args and manually, hey, if these kind of queries come, this is what you need to do. These are the systems you need to connect. So, we started building that. We didn't have a product at that time, like seven years ago when we started off. So, we started coding all those use case by use case. This is just like a giant flow chart basically. Yeah, they have giant flow chat coded on the computer, coded on the computer, right? So, that's what we did. So, that's when we realized that, okay, now we need to get the results. Are they, are we able to see reduction in the support costs? Are we seeing any increase in the revenue? Yes, and then we did that, we were able to reduce cost by 30% and increase the revenue by 20% and then, okay, now let's do it. Now, how do we make it repeatable? Okay, how do we code these flows quickly for a lot of customers, right? So, how do we do that? So, we started enabling our customers to code these use cases, themselves. So, you can code, hey, this is what my bot loans should look like. This is a flow chat or we started enabling them to code it. So, but then they still have to code them manually, use case by use case and then get it. And then at this point in time, our NLP capabilities are like first we did localized, our natural language understanding was localized. So, they understand, they can only understand the specifics of that particular use case. By this, by the version 2, we made it more repeatable and then our language understanding has become much more global plus local and then it understood a lot more use cases that I can put. And then the version 3 of it, right now, which what it is like today, you can go to the LWAI platform. I need to build a chatbot for those your life. I can just go sign up on the platform and you can actually, sorry, is my connectivity okay? Yeah, you're connectivity is just fine. Okay, so, by the version 3 of the platform, you will be able to create, now you will be able to create use cases, drag and drop, you can build as a flow chat and then deploy it. And now the language understanding has become so mature that it has learned over billions of conversations that have happened on our platform and with real world use cases. So, the language understanding is much more mature and much more global in that way. I have a question. Sorry for interrupting, but I need to say, I'm imagining that Domino is a big company and they must guessing that they have their engineering team so they can code because you mentioned that you need to code your own information in this platform in order to get your bots. So, am I right? So, for example, what happened if I'm a small company and I don't have an engineering team? So, how is the interaction or how intuitive is this platform for a small company that they don't have this big journey as Domino's, but they want to have this technological innovation. Do you provide like a consulting service? So, they can build their own code? Yeah, so that's how we transitioned over the last few years, right? We were more consulting heavy to start building the product when we started working with the enterprise companies and now we have a completely no code motion, no need to code any use case. So, you just need to drag and drop and then you can use cases, we use cases can be ready with a free trial on our website and then with from enterprise sales motion, even though we have enterprise sales question now. So, now we are like more towards like enabling SMVs or for that matter of business folks building these use cases particularly. So, now it's completely extremely low touch and you can actually go and create your own bot on your Loi platform, but multiple templates to choose from and you can get started pretty quickly. Let's test an 18. You know, we're coming into the final few minutes of our show and I wanted to bring it back to yellow AI specifically in the terms of I think it's amazing what you're able to do with conversational AI. I think the I'm sold in the sense of how this impacts both the customer experience as well as the enterprise and business itself and I think of course it is the way of the future, right? It's completely accessible. It's what everyone is so used to. You mentioned the millennials and everyone just feeling more and more comfortable with this type of dynamic. I think eventually there's never going to be a 100% you know human, I don't feel a 100 percent human replacement, like there's always going to come that point where okay time to step in agents, right? And I think it's fascinating that you have the support for the agents as well in terms of the technology, but I did want to bring it back to the company and that is what you mentioned in terms of your growth, right? Seven, eight years up to like 800 people, completely international as a co-founder and as a leader. Is there anything that you could share with other people like you who are maybe coming into this giant growth that they never really anticipated of, you know, addues and adonants like words of wisdom here of when you're experiencing hypergrowth, be sure to fill in the blank and when you're experiencing hypergrowth, be sure to not, right? Feel, fill in the blank. What was this experience like for you and your co-founders? Yeah, there's a lot of engine. I feel that we were very blind in that way and we were like, you know, we did not see any, we did not anticipate that the growth is going to be this big, but we were always like, you know, we had a blind fate, like, you know, just this is going to work. Like, you know, why would, if I look back and, you know, a few years back how we were thinking, I was like, how can we be so stupid? Like, you know, it's not obvious, but then at that point in time, we were like, yeah, we had a blind fate, yeah, we had this is the only way to execute. But then now you know that the problems that you were, you know, you would face, when, if I have to start again, probably, you know, I might not be able to execute with the same confidence, because now I know the problems. At that time, we didn't know the problems. We were like, we were, we were, we were going to execute. That's it. We just had a blind fate, right? I think go with that. Don't worry about, you know, whether it's going to work or not work, you just need to go with your cut, cut, cut. The invincibility of youth, right? Yeah, you just have to, you know, keep trying, keep, keep trying, keep pivoting, you know, keep changing, you keep course correcting yarns and as you go, but keep trying, you know, that's what I, I think, what should be doing? I love it. Just trust your gut, go with it. And I think course correcting, I think is, is of course something that's going to be inevitable. I think that's beautiful. In terms of your company culture, what, what is it like working with yellow, who do you look for, what type of characteristics are you building in your company and the people that? You're a great place to work, certificate company, right? Yeah, yeah, great, great place to work, certified company. Yeah, I think, we, when you just get come to work, come to work, come to work in yellow, right? It's just every day so challenging and stimulating. That's that's one word I would love to use, right? It's stimulating. Good way, bad way, in whichever way it's going to be very stimulating. It's on, on, because it's the market is so huge and there's so much to do. And, conversationally, I itself is evolving. It's going to be evolving for the next 10 years, so it's going to be very stimulating. And for us, it's very enjoyable journey, I would say. As a culture, we, you know, especially in engineering, right? We always love to solve problems on a day into the basis that we keep discussing problems and solutions. But then we hang out a lot, a lot more than we, you know, we solve problems. We, you know, we ride together on bike rides and we go on multiple trips together. And it's a fun culture in yellow. I love it. Yeah, I think there's that bond, right? That is really important to companies and conversational, right? I think if you're going to be, if you're going to be working on something that's supposed to emulate the human experience as much as possible, it's important to always have that human experience in mind. Well, thank you very much, Kishore, for joining us today. Unfortunately, we have come to the end of our half hour already if you can believe it or not. It was a pleasure learning from you and learning about yellow. Awesome. Pleasure is mine as well. Yeah, thank you. You're welcome. Stick around for just a minute as we go off air. But before we do, we'd like to introduce tomorrow's show. Yes, tomorrow we're going to have another show with Danielle Kivan. She is bikes president of finance at paddle and the topic is going to be about payments and buildings choosing the finance stack for your sex. How to choose the best finance stack for your SASS company and why do you should begin with the end in line tomorrow and 10 a specific. Yeah, all right. It's going to be a good show for sure. Always looking forward to it. Join us tomorrow and until then stay safe. Everyone. Kishore, thank you once again and good luck to you and yellow. Thank you so much. The next 10 years of trailblazing conversational AI. Thank you so much, Kim. Thanks America.\n"

But then it has picked up over the last five to ten years because the advancements in ML specifically and the compute right to to process that kind of a data in the last five to ten years getting this GPUs and machine learning models and so that's when it started picking up and then we started seeing more real world use cases being solved by chatbots. So, that's when the word conversationally AI is also a coin and you know, when that when the social channels started opening up their platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook where you can actually build on the top of these messaging platforms and then provide customer support or sales or any other use case of that matter.

I know 77% of the customers, they feel that you know, chatbots they would prefer to talk to a bot rather than a human because they get stuff answered pretty fast and in particularly because rather than waiting for long hours, right, we have seen that in that and that trend is more with millennials, right, they often they talk to they don't want to cons work with an agent and wait for a long time. And also, there is a 70% drop in the, you know, in the cost equation. So, basically there's a 70% reduction in the cost for enterprises where they don't have to have as many agents supporting the customers.

      " Hello everyone and happy new year. Welcome to the very first episode of 2023. This January 3rd we're very very happy to be back here live on Dojo Live. My name is Kim Lantis and it's my pleasure to be hosting along with America Guerrero. Hey happy new year everybody. You're happy new year and of course we're kicking the year up with a bang with none other than Charmine Oli who's joining us all the way from India. It's 11.30 p.m. for her y'all so she is a powerhouse. Thank you Charmine for joining us today. Thank you so much for having me here and happy new year to you Kim to America. I love your name. I do everyone else here and who's got to watch the show. Very very happy to talk about generative AI. Thank you very much for being here. I think it's a really fitting conversation for the first show of the year. I think that's a bit of serendipity. We're all about efficiency. We're all about being effective with those new year solutions. I think what you and InstaOriD are doing is going to be a really great way to kick off the year. Before we get into the specifics of in-storyed and generative AI however we would love to get to know you a bit better Charmine. You are the CEO of in-storyed but what's your story? Please what's led up to your time within story today? So yeah there's there's you know a lot to talk about when you you know ask my story. So you know like most Indians I too am an engineer that too into electronics. I don't know how that happened. So you know from one of the premier institutions in the southern part of India passed out in 2010 oops you know my age now. And then move to the US you know started working with a technology startup you know in Chicago and worked with multiple verticals from that startup you know with the companies like Pfizer and all state insurance then you know Walmart Microsoft and small companies. Yeah yeah very small that's how you know I was like oh my god these are so small really. I felt like one little land in front of these elephants but yeah you know but then almost five years then you know with $200 million plus in annual recurring revenue I was in sales throughout enterprise sales primarily that's that's my forte. And then I realized that I was just helping the rich get richer was in adding too much value to my own life and for me Charity always begins to talk. So you know decided to quit that company but then immense learning and it was that company which really you know started ingrained the idea of entrepreneurship into my brain and came back to India post that to start my first company it was in the media space the plan was to build India's very own Netflix because the Netflix revolution had already begun in the US and so you know I was hell bent in the term to build India's Netflix basically. So you know at that point in time the whole internet revolution hadn't really picked up in India as much you know so the Indian audiences were still very much prone to consuming content on their television sets or you know I mean radio etc. So you know the shift to digital right I mean consuming content on their mobile devices or on laptops hadn't really taken place. So we started creating a lot of content on you know YouTube on Vimeo. Now as opposed to being an aggregator we were essentially building our own content something that even Netflix and Prime do now. So you know wrote about 70 plus content had over you know 5 million plus views on our channel so over 300,000 plus drivers but then you know we soon understood that we were a little ahead of our time and as we know that for any startup to actually witness that Pakistan growth and then you know grow out of the death valley as they say. For that the timing has to be perfect. So you know we he sort of understood that the timing wasn't so perfect. So we ended up selling the copyrights of all the scripts to a Bombay based production house, Bollywood yes and you know took the money, exited because I read this is the you know that was to do at that point in time and 18 months later you know what what happened is that the whole internet revolution just sprung up suddenly and then you know it's kind of overwhelming because now I see some of the content that I wrote trending on Prime and I'm like had I waited for 80 more months but yes anyway it was it was it was a great learning, great team building and you know we we learned a lot we did a lot of things and then I'm sorry it's my dad. Don't worry hi dad you could hear Sansa my dog barking earlier so and at any moment I'm sure Zoe my daughter will come walking. Yeah you know I'm at home I mean at my parents' home so you know I can't do anything they're like walking around yeah so yes and then you know sold that company and then wrote two books got them published. One was the non-stabest fellow back in 2019 by the Indian Express and the Oxford bookstores you know basically books about entrepreneurship about you know what is it like to basically follow your true calling all of these things and that's when I decided that you know I think I know what my true calling is and I've always loved content of course that's the reason for us to video content and then you know after writing books I realized that challenges that you know marketing people face globally is you know essentially into content generation analysis how do you resonate with your customers how do you make your content stick all of these things right so I was like I want to build an end-to-end platform you know like a full stack offering which can essentially help content marketers globally generate better content and all of course using technology right because you want to improve the efficiency make things more productive so that is how in story it actually started and you know in story does the name reads inside stories right so you know that's how it happened and you know then we were like okay we we have to do this so yeah and started officially in 2019 and you know it's almost like exactly exactly I was just coming to that you know so we are we are a pre-COVID company but then actually you know the thing is that I mean COVID was actually a blessing in disguise for us because you know we were able to identify a huge opportunity in this adversity you know as a result of which what I'm so sorry I think my dad just just loves to be in the background no apologies that's the beauty of a life what is your way it's like very much well from home I'm so sorry guys but yeah you know I'm so human right I mean I haven't really put anything any any any virtual you know background nothing no we love it all about you and I think as you know as the content creator it's the the genuine nature in the human side of us you know one question that I get asked very often is that so is AI going to take over look guys no it's not my dad is still walking around as long as he remains clothed charming we'll be fighting I think he knows that so yes you know like um so just like I was saying that you know we were able to identify a huge opportunity in this adversity and um you know as a result of that we then understood that yes this is what we want to do uh use technology to you know help people create better content uh now you know another great thing that happened to us is that you know um we decided to come up with a full stack offering now you know let's say we do seven different things there are seven companies out there which are you know doing one each of that thing right so we were like okay instead of you know you trying out seven different tools and paying fifty dollars for each so instead of paying three fifty dollars why not just use one in story tool and pay fifty dollars only for all that right so I was like this makes complete sense you know as in have a full stack offering one go to platform uh something like an agency on steroids right you know which can which can you know do all of your content generation analysis grammar checking spell checking plagiarism checking um you know then panel analysis if you want to get your content you know sort of gauge by a panel of people your customers editors whoever and you know headline generation recommendations whatever never that we are doing it you know everything so the whole idea is to ensure that you know I mean of course why do you want to spend three fifty dollars for seven different tools and even SEOs all of that now right so uh yeah that's that's what we do that's how it's story happened then the COVID actually we were able to witness our Pakistan growth and you know um essentially uh gain the product market fit that you know most companies are looking at we were able to achieve that thanks to COVID well congratulations first of all I think your your personal story is is it very exciting and very interesting one I also really get the sense of yes just perseverance and um this williness to just just go for it from you and genuinely happy I think with what you're doing and what you're building um and so congratulations there which brings us to the actual topic I think we've touched on this quite a bit with what in story is capable of doing but we're going to dive deeper into what's that America generative AI for content marketing how can marketers accelerate content generation with AI so why dystopic why is it important Charmin so you know first of all um you know before I delve into why is it important right I think it's important to understand how did this even come into the picture right you know earlier it was all about grammar corrections spelling correction I mean of course we know the market leaders in in you know into these particular features right so the whole reason why content generation has now become I mean content generation using AI which is basically generative AI the whole reason why it's become such a buzz is uh uh you know and and of course you cannot not talk about companies like open AI and you know GPT-3 and and now chat GPT and then you know Google's Lambda and then I mean all of these things right I mean we've we've all heard of these names uh so the the reason why this is coming to picture is because you know when you look at a company um irrespective of whether it is a pandemic or a recession each and every company out there needs to do some sort of marketing you know at least because if you have to sell a product I mean be it a software product a physical product or anything for that matter even a service right you would need to reach out to your customers right so and ironically that's the place I think one of the places when people start to panic that they exactly tend to leave to their wayside yeah you know exactly because because you don't know what you know what will essentially work for you what won't work for you right I mean marketing is like this whole huge uh you know cosmic zone that you're entering and you don't know whether you've reached Milky Way or you've reached any other galaxy right I mean if it if it clicks it clicks if not you know it's it's it's it's it's a lot of basically trial and error and then figuring out what is working for you so as a result which there's a lot of money that that that goes into this so you know as a result of this what happens is that now how do you reach out to the right set of people right I mean uh content generators digital marketers or you know whether you want to outsource it to an agency now if you look at the whole content life cycle right there is you know how do you start the first thing is that you would conduct research about the kind of content that you want to create right and you know also do a little market study understand what your you know your what your competitors are doing with respect to their content uh right and what is their marketing strategy and then uh second stage would be to you know essentially come up with a whole strategy right now this strategy involves multiple things things like for example um you know figuring out what your marketing budget is the most basic thing right I mean how much do you want to spend on your search ads Instagram ads Facebook ads I mean whatever that you're looking at or if you have the money then you might even want to spend money on programmatic media buying right I mean which is which is a completely different universe altogether but if you look at the base all of this is completely driven by content right I mean you know be shot form long form whatever that you want right I mean emails blogs ads or you know I mean ads on leading twitter Facebook Instagram any other channel or I mean display ads even if you know I'm sure you've seen uh display ads on youtube and you know videos that that essentially keep running if you haven't got a you know a premium youtube version then in that case what happens is that if you're watching a video you know in between you might see some of these videos running which which which which essentially are you know these these display advertising basically which is nothing but the whole programmatic side of things which is quite expensive but then it it it gives you you know a lot more visibility and it is not that expensive as television ads or you know I mean advertising on let's say print media is so as a result that a lot of people are you know definitely interested plus because it's so digital you know and it's on your mobile phone you know as in reaching out to your customer this is a programmatic topic you know you know let's do you know do anything I'll listen to her and then at the end of the day and the husband's like okay I gotta listen to my wife because I need some peace in my life you know my wife is always correct similarly programmatic is like you know it'll it'll keep throwing ads continuously at you unless and until you actually go and click on that impression is they say the what is it the squeaky wheel gets oiled first yes exactly exactly you know so people are like okay let me just get done with this okay I'll do it wife is always right similarly programmatic is always right you know so but then yes it is a little more expensive but then you know the the content right the the display content that is essentially so important otherwise why would anyone even take a look at it so you know the the whole strategy around that and then content generation and then distributing it on whatever media that you want to distribute it on platforms forums that that you're partnered with communities etc and then finally of course measuring what your engagement and you know what kind of numbers have you reached right I mean all of these things now if you look at the final stage you know the the whole engagement metric essentially now there if you look at it there are multiple platforms that are you know doing this of course needless to say the most emphasized one being of course Google analytics you know because it's it's it's one of the oldest but the challenge with GA is that you know it gives you a very quantitative summary of how your content has performed things like number of likes or you know I mean number of page visits I mean things like the right it's extremely basic now the challenge is that although you spend so much money on your ads you know on your campaigns there is no way for you to understand why are you still not getting the kind of engagement that you were expecting to get right now that's the biggest challenge there is no way to gauge that was it a quality problem or was I not doing something right all of these things right so that's when we realized that you know the challenge here is first of all to tackle how do you analyze whether the content is actually resonating with your audiences or not so as a result of that you know what we did is that we first built an analysis engine you know now what will happen is that as a as a customer let's say right if if you're looking at promoting your content now how do you analyze it initially very very manual intuition driven right you know you would just ask around people that okay is this looking fine is this not looking fine etc things like that right but there is no tech driven approach so as a result of that what we did is that you know we built an analysis engine the world's first platform which will tell you you know with a very predictive caution that okay this is how your content is going to perform based on so many metrics that it can measure and it can also give you smart recommendations on the kind of words that you need to use in order to improve that engagement you know now that is something completely breakthrough now that's what we built initially to essentially help audiences right I mean here generative AI is essentially you know I mean so generative AI in the analysis aspect of things right and that's that's how a number of other companies also started you know I mean generative AI into the whole analysis space to basically analyze content because it was completely intuition driven which was very very you know inefficient and productive I mean how can how can the human mind be like okay this is sounding good this is sounding right you know I mean it's very very so as opposed to tech knowledge but within story can it can interrupt for just one moment to make sure I understand correctly what you're capable of doing or what your part of your generative AI is analyzing content before it's actually published so you can so that when it comes time to pun it publishing I was gonna say punishing we're not gonna punish we do not want to punish with our content when it comes to publishing our content then the success rate in theory is going to be a lot higher even before you spend a penny other than your in-storey description better absolutely absolutely yeah you know so that is essentially how generative AI also you know the advent of generative AI essentially I mean that's how the whole thing began you know it originally started from the analysis side of things now once people figured out analysis what next right I mean the the next thing is that you know content writers out there are expensive you know I mean good quality content writers right there is there is a huge huge demand right I mean yes of course there is a whole freelancer universe out there I mean on on on platforms like Fiber or you know Upwork etc right you can you can definitely get someone to generate content for you but the challenge with a freelancer is that you know fixed number of revisions right I mean end you know there might be repetitive content correct I mean they might be creating let's say for example if you are a retail company right now he might have created similar content for 100 other folks so there can be some repetition plagiarism issues all of that right plus of course expensive and you know if if if you are someone on a tight budget then what do you do right and then you know once the content is generated then again you need to get it analyzed you need to get it published etc into and you know I mean lots of lots of challenges how do you know if he's actually use the right keywords I mean for example if you do not come from a marketing background at all and you know you're a founder you're the CEO CTO who's looking at generating content and let's say if you can't afford a CMO in house then you know you don't have a choice but to rely on these freelancers so again a huge challenge right so that was essentially how the birth of you know generative AI for generating content actually started so you know thanks to of course GPT-3 which you know I mean there were GPT-1 2 of course but then they were not as you know as as well known as GPT-3 because what happened with GPT-3 is that you know they used over 1 billion plus data points now you know that's that's essentially you know training the system a lot more now you know just just just for the better understanding of our audiences right I mean I I hate talking too much technology I want to talk like simple label terms now how this works is very very simple now when I say data points what that means is that you know let's say if I have 1 billion plus right and if I have tagged them to you know the right tools the right emotions and I'm explained it to my machine you know by segmenting these sentences into multiple clusters into you know groups and each group meaning a particular thing right and then I would train my system my my my engine with you know all of these data points so these data points these sentences words etc whatever that it is these are the input and now my system has become smart enough because it has seen what the output is like for you know all of these sentences words and then so automatically it starts generating responses you know so let's say if I were to put in a few keywords like you know so if if you were to go on to the in-story generative you know content generation tool what you would do is that for example if you want to write an email right I mean a sales email for example let's say now who is your audience like is it is it someone who is you know very very knowledgeable not so knowledgeable or you know I mean okay okay knowledgeable right so you get to select the filter that that you want to you know so basically there is a grade of understanding based on you know who you are essentially targeting your content to and then you know the number of words that you want the number of iterations that you want and also a few other criteria like what emotions do you want to put into them like you know I mean if it is that let's say if you're selling to someone from the healthcare side then you know I mean insurance etc some alarming kind of content fear should be you know one one very very expected emotion if it is to a parent you know expecting parents and if you are selling it let's say baby products so you know joy etc right I mean such kind of emotions and then in a matter of two to three seconds the content is generated right but but how the underlying phenomena works and you know how it actually started is the the whole reason was you know the whole inefficiency productivity now for those one you know those those wondering that and and and and probably comprehending that I was telling me that AI is going to completely render my content writer and house obsolete so no you know that is one question that each and every customer of my is always asking me all we are saying is that you know AI is not here to completely replace human writers you know no that's that's not the agenda because no AI can you know at the end of the day we have billions of neurons in our head which are you know doing all the magic you know a machine doesn't have that of course a machine is completely dependent on the data that you feed it right now for a machine to gain that level of smartness you know I don't think that is that is possible ever so you know the whole reason why AI is doing this is because what we want is to create your you know is to help you aid you in your content generation lifecycle now you know instead of hiring 10 content writers and spending a lot of money you can hire probably three right and you know get them to generate content through the AI engine that you know the story is built on top of GPT-3 of course and you know get that output and then play around with it right so you know the the whole idea here is to make your generation much more productive and whatever money that you save because you're not using seven different platforms in just 50 dollars which which I think is a lot cheap 50 dollars per month and whatever money that you save you can actually direct that money into your search ads right I mean increase your marketing budget so you know especially very very exciting proposition for you know startups right I mean companies that and especially during recession if you're looking at saving money into marketing because because you know marketing is so important no matter what situation you are in you have to market so I think generative AI is definitely you know the go to play is you know when you when you want to during a pandemic or a recession yeah I think that makes a lot of sense you know we're here to be the kind of final few minutes of today's show if you can believe it or not but I wanted to ask about the marketers themselves presumably it's the marketers who are using in in story and this idea of them accelerating what they're doing what what kind of impact is your generative generative AI have on them and their jobs their lives in terms of like for example for me I'm not necessarily in the marketing space but I do experience sort of this perfection paralysis right where it's like I wanted to be so perfect that it's hard for me to create anything at all so is that like an example of how you're able to help marketers sort of just push and break through are they coming is the AI generating maybe ideas for them that they might not have father them their own like what is it the benefits that you're seeing for the people who are using your product so you know right now we have about three million plus users you know with we've actually got some very exciting very constructive feedback I should say you know from from our users and the first thing that a lot of them told me is that you know it's saving a lot of my time you know which which which definitely enables them to do a lot more right than what what they were doing because if you remember what I said right I mean conducting research and then strategize and then generate and then edit and then publish and then gauge what your engagement is like five stages a lot of work you know now if you're you know if the technology that we've built can actually help you you know increase your productivity by at least 30% now that's that's a lot of time that you've saved right so I think technology's biggest you know responsibility is to help us humans you know ensure that we are getting more efficient and saving time with with the work that we are doing so and as a result of which you are actually accelerating your whole growth cycle right so that is the number one feedback that I have got from you know people and of course the the second thing is that can you also add SEOs can you also add a plagiarism checker can you also add this and we actually did that now so you know now we have seven different features so you know one company to replace seven companies essentially you know which which basically would make your productivity even higher you know so so far we've had a web app now people are asking for APIs and then you know a Chrome extension and then you know a keypad which you can just download from from your iOS Android or you know and then integrate on your mobile apps and you know then so so picture this right let's say if you know if you are on a dating platform and if you are a man because most men don't know how to chat with the women so you know picture yeah so you know you know I mean picture this right I mean when you are chatting with someone on a dating platform and then you suddenly start getting feedback from the machine that you know what do you want this to end up in a date why don't you make your content a little more romantic right now you're sounding like you know I mean too dominating women don't like this so let me tell you how to make this a little more comfortable so that you know your chances of landing up a date increases that's exactly reminds me of oh no there's the book it's a it's French isn't it the play where there's the the genre the guy with the big nose who's in love oh yes yes the words are the ones that causing the other guys to fall what yeah I don't remember but it's very very sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah so you know I mean basically I'm on a mission to help men look look look look for the in-story date app in the next I mean we want build a dating app but then you know we will integrate with with with other apps yes of course I can no I I perfectly understand the analogy and I think I think it's wonderful well I sure mean you know we're at the end of our time today it's really interesting speaking with you learning your story the in-story story and of course all about generative AI I think this was much more um what's the word I'm looking for it just makes the whole idea of and your conversation today has made generative AI so much easier to understand the marketing process from start to finish and of course how technology is here to accelerate that to supplement that and not take it over and so thank you very much for everything that you've shared with us today thank you so much everyone and thank you came in America for this opportunity America I must say I love your name you really you just imagine America I want to see an American uh open president yeah but my name hasn't happened in the States or Mexico yet so yeah I felt just to tell you that my name is because here in Mexico there is a soccer team which is called America and my father used to be a huge fan of that soccer team but not because they hold yeah no not because of that yeah it's completely sports related and we love it we might be asking do you have a sister named Fadi no I have no my daughter's best friend is Nandia Germany does that count are you serious why I'm absolutely serious I know I know I know um you know I mean a friend of mine has named her daughter India what yeah no I don't know I'm just in his America right is someone from India who would think and to me I like India's much better name like kidding no no dig to your name of America of course it just sounds more exotic I think there's something about the exotic that is appealing to us as a boy thank you so much thank you so much I'm sure to mean yeah if yes I came you can share the link I'd love to share it you know on my social media of course we'll go ahead and take care of that here in our on our post show wrap up so stick around for just a minute as we go off air but we did before we do go off air we would like to introduce to our audience Thursday's show we do have one more show this week uh America yes we're going to have a show

      " Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of Doja Live this Thursday January 12th, 2023. My name is Kim Lantis and it's my pleasure to be hosting today along with America Guerrero. Hello everybody, exciting for being here. Yes, it's always exciting here on Doja Live because we always get to speak to really amazing individuals in the tech industry and today it's none other than Paul Ellerd who is the co-founder and CEO of Impact. Paul, thank you so much for joining us on Doja Live today. It's a real pleasure. Yes, we're laughing at the differences here between what we're experiencing in Mexico and what you're experiencing in Montreal. Yeah, I'm sorry everybody, so it's worth it. I mean the countryside, it's not quite Montreal. So that's no, and in Mexico, I guess you don't want to have as much. No, snow, I would show you the view out my window, but it's just a parking lot. That's great. Yeah, no snow, but I do miss the snow. And I can only imagine how beautiful this scenery is where you are when there's all the foliage and the leaves on the trees. But that's not what we're here to talk about, right? Today we're here to talk about AI and non-planetary reporting. But before we do that, we'd love to get to know a bit about you, Paul, your story, your passion, what's kind of led up to the founding of impact. Please share your story. Well, I've been, first of all, I was born in, as I was talking to you, the show I was born in Midwest Canada, so in Winnipeg, not far from your home place. So I moved in Eastern Canada, so in Quebec, I followed my father, as I was young and I studied in engineering and I have also a degree in chair. As a musician, I'm a cellist and I did an MD in Finance afterwards. But most of all, over the last 20 years, I've created media tech companies. So this was what nobody would employ me anyways. So I had to create my own companies. And I was specialized in media tech. And the story is interesting and I did a few going public transaction and one of those was in 2000. It was the first time fresh out of the MBA in Finance. I thought I knew everything about Finance. And I worked with an investment banker, investment bank for a year prior to us going public. My company called Zach Technology in the internet period. And I was astonished in that my first experience when we went public and I lived it for a few years, I was astonished to learn that what I've learned in school had nothing to do with real life. I learned some stuff that was happening in Finance that I couldn't believe it exists. So when we talk about short selling, pump and dump, we CDOs, triple CDOs, futures and all these derivative products, which had absolutely no link with the real economy. That was my first call to the waking call. I woke up and I said, whoa, most of the people around here living in real life are missing the point of a whole new universe called the financial economy and the financial economy which led us to the catastrophes where the cliff were on in turn environment and revenue and wealth sharing in terms of all what we were living in terms of crises today. Well, this same financial economy, without it, we will not be able to transform our economy towards a sustainable structure. So this is where, but in 2000, so what happened my personal personally, I started to read everything on the finance world, understanding what investment bank was doing, what a traditional bank, how the rating companies played, how the insurance played, how the central banks, the creation of money, so on and so forth. And it's not so complicated, but it's a game with rules that were invented by people and human beings and especially by a kind of a new set of rules established by the Chicago School of Economy, Milton Friedman, which in real life has never demonstrated that it was really effective in terms of their theory. Should it be trickled down, should you let the market decide it will be best for people, all that is, excuse me, the world bullshit. We know that today. But that was, and they still, still the rules on which each financial professional are still playing, and the economy is playing. And they still pretend it's a hard science, which is not. It's like it's a guess and we try to think and project, and most of the economists, you'll find as many economists saying the otherwise than the one that says it's in this direction. So making a short story, long story shorter, so I ran my companies and I sold my last participation in Media Tech Company 2014 and I went about doing some of my name in New York for a year and a half, where I really, what I enjoy is supporting entrepreneurs, because the most difficult job in our economy is creating a company from scratch and you know probably what it is, because you're in that same situation and having there are first sales and make it sustainable in terms of viable. This is the most difficult job in the world. As I say, a lot to my clients, which are bankers, running a big bank, you could put a monkey running a big bank and it would still be profitable for five years. And that's the reality, because the critical mass is there, the structure is that. Yes, it requires skills, but really a talent and a rainmaker is needed when you create a company. So I did M&A and after that, we decided with my co-founder, Tima, we decided to create impact analytics, because we thought there was only one thing for me that had purpose is that we needed to contribute, even though it was a small drop in the ocean. If I wanted to come back as an entrepreneur, it was only by putting in place something that could contribute to the most pressing issues that our society is facing. And I had to be in the sector in which I was, technology, and I understood the finance. So I said, okay, what can we transform and what could we do to bring a sense and purpose to what's happening and participate in the more than needed transformation of our economies. So this is where we created impact. An impact mission, it's an impact driven company in a B-Core. In our mission, in our governance, also is based on that. Each time we take a decision, we are looking at not only the financial aspect, but the impact mission we have. And if it doesn't achieve, and it doesn't seem to go in the direction or mission, we don't even look at the financial aspects, it's discarded. So this is the way I think that future companies should and must and will be managed, not only taking into account the financial performance, which is important in terms of sustainability, but primary, taking into account the negative and positive impact on society and on environment in order to sustain the real wealth that needs to be created. So when we identified that, I said, where can we play? And one thing that we've identified at that time is that there was a lack of genuine transparency. And at that time in 2017, 2018, the financial markets started to launch sustainable products, sustainable financial products with all these promises. But they were only grabbing the market and doing a lot of marketing with no fundamentals, no measurement, no verification of the facts they were selling to investors seeking purpose with their money. And that was where it triggered and said, okay, that's the opportunity. The same way we had to standardize and put a lot of more rigor into the financial reporting in 1929 in United States when there was a big crisis, there was a law in 1933 saying that now and going forward, we need to have audited financial statements that are on the same standard and that are rigorous and you can be sued and put in prison if you play with it and mess around with this. The same thing is happening for impact assessments, which is what is the impact of a company on environment and on social and you need to have this standardized impact statements that will be used in the business process. And every single business process and the food chain of the financial institutions should it be lending, should it be investing. So my view is that we are today in a very, very exciting turning point where we're shifting from the financial economy towards an impact economy. And shifts takes about three, four, five, ten, sometimes ten years, but it's happening in COVID and this what we all lived on the planet for two years has accelerated this transformation. And what is an impact economy? Is an economy where every economic agent, when they do buying, when they do investing, when they go lending, when they do taxing, won't only take into account the financial performance, the impact performance of any organization, small, big, private listed, for profits, non-profit, the same way we see the financial statements for all these organizations, you'll expect and the social permit to operate will be to produce your impact statement and have it audited by a third party, the same way you do with your financial statements, the view we have. So this is what we decided to focus on in 2018 to become the moodies of impact by providing the highest quality, standardized, comparable impact assessments to the financial sector so that they stop improvising and they start being professional about how they do an analysis of extra financial data. So that's in a nutshell. I love it. What the entire mission and the entire business behind what you do is this pursuit of a standardization and the certification for these financial institutions, correct? Well, for the financial institution, we provide impact assessments of any private or listed companies. Okay. Exactly. So the same way they need to work if to do their work, they need to have financial statements audited by KPMGs or any companies with who they work. The same way they'll need impact assessment. That's what we provide them with. Lovely. To kind of give them everything they need to make the best decisions. Correct. And when they have that, they have the real picture. It's not a kind of a complete picture of what a company markets, but it's real, the real picture of as accurately possible of what are the negative impact they mitigate? What are the positive impact they generate by transforming their model? So after that, the investor or the lender will make their choice, but based on qualitative intelligence. And that's what lacks today in the market. It makes a lot of sense, this space that you're filling. And I think it brings us to this topic of today's conversation and wanting to answer this question of how, right? How is technology helping the financial sector? Like you said, to channel their capital towards these businesses that they feel are having a worthwhile positive social or environmental impact. My biggest question I think is we get, I'm on board, right? I get it. But I think I can't help. I tend to be this, in a lot of ways, this half-class fall, to give people the benefit of the doubts. Some might think even now you've in some ways in which the world could slash should work. So my question for you is the real why? What is motivating companies to want to do this, particularly in the financial industry, because for so long throughout humanity, we have a saying for it, money talks. So I'm just really, really interested in the, for lack of a better word, the buy-in here. Like what's the why? I get it. But how do you, today, in 2023, unless you're really dumb and you don't read, economy lives into, and lives and will be successful in a wealthy, healthy, in an economy lives in an environment. And if the environment isn't existing anymore, you won't have any economy living. So as simple as that, if you want to sell, if you want to produce services, goods, and everything disappears because the, there's, like in California, droughts or there's too much water or everything is being destroyed, there's no such thing as a structured economy. So unless you're really dumb and there's still a lot of dumb people. A lot of people. Yeah. Well, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's exactly. It's really happening. They look at the window and they see all the snow on the ground outside of Montreal and think global warming would. But and so if you come back, yes, it's all about if you want to be sustainable in terms of financial aspects of it, because money talks, as you say, the first thing is that you have to have a market that exists in Spain and is, is, is there in 10 in 20 in 30 years? So that's a big, but other than that, I think that most investors, individual investors, today, there's more and more investors in which also represents pension funds and insurers that wants to invest in, in, in, in sectors that are not destroying this ecosystem in which they thrive. That's the pure logic. So they're asking the money managers, the banks to hate, we insist and, and now following today, following that movement started 15 years ago, there's the regulators in Europe. That are not putting it as mandatory, because it costs a fortune to after drought or after a catastrophe for states. So they say, ho ho ho, we also, it's all about money again. But whatever the reason today, the movement of the regulations, the, the funders, the investors, institution investors, individual investors are asking for impact results. And also a return on investment. Yeah. Both are possible. And when you think about it, the biggest, the most successful potential business plan is if you attack these major, these major, this major crises, which we all face, because this will be in demand. Look at companies facing and, and trying to come up with a solution. Well, they'll be in demand and, and this will increasingly come and live as, as an example, when we started, I was preaching in the desert in 2018. But today, the incoming calls are saying, yeah, I heard that you could do this and this. Now it's, it's needed, it's mandatory, it's our territory. We need more and more and more stuff. It's like we're in a boat and the wind is pushing in our backs, not in, in your face. It's a real change. Yeah, correct. So, that's beautiful, extremely hopeful. See that again. I was saying it's beautiful in a way. I find it to be extremely hopeful. It is all hopeful, but it doesn't move fast enough. I think that there's still a lot of lack of courage within the managers of these big companies, where they're there sitting way. I'm not sure. I may take a risk. And yes, if you want to move and take a step in the next step to get on the next level, you always take a risk of falling back. And I'm looking at you guys, when you launched Dojo, where was it risk? To innovate, to change, to transform, to live, there's a risk. So that's the problem of a lot of big organization, where the managers has been trained to minimize and not take a risk, because they prefer making more money, whatever the effect in the short term. So, that's about making sure that there's more and more courage within the big companies. The big financial institutions to go into that direction, because it's a question of time. We have no time left. There's less than 10 years. And it's not as if we didn't know about it. The science is all around that since 1972, with the first Red O's report. So I think that today, it's nice. It's great to see that it's moving in the right direction. It's fantastic to see that everybody agrees, finally, that there's a real challenge collectively. But now we need to take action and put our efforts. And it's not as if we cannot put efforts. Look at the COVID crises. Rich countries took decisions of printing cash to save, and that was the right thing to do to invest into people and companies to make sure that after the crisis, the economy would still sustain. And it was done in United States, in Canada, in Spain, in France, in UK, and all the countries that immediately invested it, not a bit, but thousands of buildings. They are on the right track. So you can, we could do that collectively, but we need to see, and people in, it's funny that humans are all the same if we don't see and feel the threat in our book. We won't move. We won't. But there is, like you said, this need for speed. I'm playing out of the colloquial things today. Money talks need for speed, etc. But let's talk about then this speed, the impact what you're doing brings with this AI, this artificial intelligence component. Is that what you're pushing? Is that what's helping make this more possible? Well, two things. First, when we talk about artificial intelligence, it's a, it's a new thing, but that exists, that has been existing for the last 30 years. Let's face it. But it's the new, the new fact. It's a turning word. I always say that I've been involved in artificial intelligence for 20 years. Before having a successful artificial intelligence algorithm, you need to have NI, natural intelligence. Today, in our sector, specifically of environment and social governance indicators, it's such a mess in terms of structured data that we invested a lot of time in human intelligence to structure, to formalize, to build libraries of definitions, libraries of standards, so that AI could kick in and be able to scale up. And it's starting now. It's starting. We're starting to see the results. But it's the one that I always say today that to provide a good impact assessment of a company, you cannot only count on AI because the AI today suffers from the gigawiffing, garbage in, garbage out. So if you do not have the right structure data first, and once you have it, it's a good thing. So we're going to add value to it, and we're still in this, for the next five years, the human has to put the context, contextualize, add some value to the raw data that is currently used in the market. So that's where we are a human-admented intelligence fintech, where we use people to add value, and we optimize and use AI and BI to optimize the things that can be automated, and that there's not really added value from a human being. So it's a combination of both. And why is that? Is that the market in terms of what we call extra financial data, or environment and social and government's data, is so new that it's 15 years. And the first generation of providers, such as the big guys like MSCI, SustainableTix, Moody's, TrueCost, they had to invent their methodology, so which they had no choice, they were not. But today, as of today, they need to move and stop using their homing methodology, which are black box, in which are incomplete, and they need to move the next level, what we call the extra financial ESG 2.0, which we are. And because today, since 2015, there is a framework, an international consensus framework, called the Impact Management Project, and that's what we've chosen in 2018 to build all of our tech and AI and our methodology on. And this is, it was a bit in that time, because we weren't sure if it would be adapted by the countries or by the big potential clients. But today, the IMP is behind all standards, all frameworks, all regulations in Europe, and definitely in North America, which is a few years later than Europe. And also the big companies, the big asset managers, banks are choosing also the IMP, because it's the framework that provides them with the maximum intelligence. And to take better decisions, you need to have more intelligence. So coming back to your question, AI is central. But you cannot come up with high quality intelligence without human intervention. And the same applies for financial credit analysis. You never see, and you won't see, from Moodies or from a Fitch or from Essent, you will see human intervention in a real analysis to see the, to contextualize the indicators, to see in one sector, to see, you need, and you will need to have always human intervention. So this is the path that we've decided to work on, which implies a lot of challenges on our side, because it's cost, it's more costly. And when we're in a nursing market, and you're selling very high performance, full electric car, and you're still using a horse, you don't see the value. And this is, but now we're catching up, because there's a lot of scandals, greenwashing, fatwashing, which represents a reclassification of products that weren't, weren't delivering the promises. And this is an opportunity for us, but our, our, our strategy was to aim at high quality intelligence based on, on, on, on rigor, based on comparability, transparency, and human intervention, how scalable by AI and BI. So that's a combination that we are still on, on, in terms of, if, in strategy. And without AI, we couldn't be as effective as, productive, as scalable, as we are, if we didn't have put in place all sort of business intelligence tool, scraping tools, NLP, natural language, we're setting tools to collect the data, to do some work that a human being don't need really to do or less effective than a machine. But once the machine has its limit, the human intervenes and adds value to give a result that is the highest quality data that gives maximum intelligence for a decision maker. Yeah, and I'm actually kind of blown away as far, at least the shows that I've participated in over these last six plus years. And I'm talking about probably hundreds. I think your show is the first show I've actually heard this term of natural intelligence, coined along with artificial intelligence. And I find this both mind-blowing and a little sad because it makes so much sense to me, what it is that you're saying. And as we come to the final minutes of the show, I think America is going to touch specifically on impact and the company you're building, the culture you're building. But before we do that, I do have one final question. You talked earlier in the show about being courageous. And I think that's really important in your experience. And I think maybe in some ways this is a generational gap that's been filled, right, with older individuals now exiting the business. It's talking about me being courageous. No, of course not you. But younger generations who I feel are sent to have a bit more of a wide-eyed sense of what's actually happening in the world around us in terms of social and environmental and impact, right? But how can we increase the courage, right? This necessary courage amongst current leadership and upcoming leadership to get on board. I think courage comes with one thing is long-term goals. You can't have courage if you're only seeking short-term wins. And I think there's a relationship with the purpose. So if you have a real purpose in which you really believe and you think that you're convinced about it, you know it will take time. And you do align your decisions based on this mission. And it provides you with a guideline which could translate into courage at the time. But at the end, it's not even courage. It's just being coherent with yourself. So courage comes from with you need to be coherent with yourself. And that's what needs to be embedded in top management courses where sometimes you are brainwashed by your schools, by your, as I said, the Milton Friedman approach. And you think, no, you need to listen to yourself and come back to and have the courage of sometimes losing a short-term advantage that finally is not a long-term win if you take that decision. And in facing also your bosses or your, and even though you think that you're the only thing person thinking something, if you speak it out loud properly, there's everything could be said, but it has to be said with respect. If you come up with your argument, you'll see that you're not the only one thinking that. And that's surprising. Absolutely true. I have the courage of your beliefs and being in line and coherent with your long-term purposes. And that makes sense. And don't forget at the basis that you're a human being and your job is just a nice to have. It's not sincerely. When you die at the end, you only remember your kids, your family, your loved one, and music, and that's it. Music. Oh, that's beautiful. I would like to ask you about the natural intelligence that you have inside of your company. The culture that you're building, your people, how is the culture, the values? Well, that piece is my co-founder, Tima. So she's the one in charge, and we were looking for titles at the beginning. In her title, she's a CEO, she's the general manager, but her official title is Chief Happiness Officer. And so we've implanted with courage and sometimes mistakes and errors, we try to have a horizontal transversal organization where collective intelligence is really our core value and our richness and to get to that collective intelligence. You need to take each individual and make them being happy, understand why they are there, coming back to the purpose, and to see that they're in a safe zone that they can become what they want to become and do things that they're happy to be doing. Not only stop that they're happy, but mostly they have a plan of the really the right spot so that they can contribute to the collective intelligence of our organization. And without that, we wouldn't have gone through the first months of the COVID crisis. It's as simple as that. We would have been like a lot of companies, we would have disappeared, and we asked all of our employees at that time, and we were 25, 30, we said, look, we're in a crash crunch. What do we do? We stop here or we take, we collectively transparency. What can be done and what's your leeway, who can, who cannot, and let's get organized together. That's what we've done. It went through, and today we're 135 people. Wow. Wow. That's amazing. It's a beautiful story of this willingness to give, to move and order. And the real purpose of what you do at Impact, right? Because the, the, the song is bigger than the individual parts, right? Yes. And we don't see that when we look at our company or our clients, or, but when you live it from, from within, we have all sort of, of initiatives like the, the, the, we are a team of mornings of Mondays and Fridays, we have some, some committee on, on Jedi committee, which is a, it really, really something about inclusion, diversity, and all these subject that are, are super important that we discuss that between ourselves. And we have also some lunch and learns where people talk about their passion, not about only job, but here's what I've done in learning curves about, of, of how systematic racism can be dealt with, how can be, we can be an ally, stuff like that. In, in this is part of, of the richness and, in making sure that people are, are sticks are, sticks around because they learn stuff. They're happy. They're, it's not that there's no challenges, but they know that if they can express themselves and they're supported by, by their colleagues and, and the, the organization. So we have a flat organization with bubbles, the head of bubbles, we have safe spaces, we have, it's really organic. And it's funny because we, when we talk to the financial or VCs, specifically what's your, what's your, what's your, your structure? When I see your, or chart, they say, yeah, but, okay, we show it in a chart, there's bubbles and it's, it's, it's not like this, you know, it's, there's like, okay, that's your or chart? Yeah, it's our, or chart. So we need to rebuild and rethink, rethink structures in way that works for us and people in order to, to, to collectively be successful and to collectively achieve our mission, which is an impact mission. Yeah, it's something very similar to what we have going on here at, and Kora and Delge alive as well. Perfect. Paul, I feel like I could sit here and listen to you all day, tell the impact story and so much to learn from you. I think you've shared some really amazing nuggets of wisdom with us today and I'm so happy to get to know you, to get to know impact better as you help other organizations, you know, collectively build the future that we, we all need in terms of what's happening in society and the environment and space in which we all live and share. Yeah, so thank you all for your time. We all live and share that, that's, that's a, let's keep in mind that we all live and share the same ecosystem. Thank you. Thank you again. Stick around to some minute as we go off air, but before we do America, what do we have going on tomorrow? Yes, tomorrow we're going to have our show, not at 10 a.m. Pacific, it's going to be at 9 a.m. Pacific and it's going to be our third or second episode of the metaverse segment. The second right, the second one and the topic is going to be about finances inside and outside the metaverse, how are both virtual money and real money being used inside the metaverse and what does this mean for brands, funding and market share. The conversation is going to be with Firm and Chavez, Daniela Gamboa and Napura Bantica. Tomorrow and I am. Yes, that's right. 9 a.m. we had to switch it up because the poor R.T.M.A. is all the way in India and we didn't want it to make it too too late for her. So see you tomorrow at 9 a.m. right here in Dodolive. Thank you again Paul. Was it pleasure? Thanks. Bye for now.\n"

So this is where, but in 2000, so what happened my personal personally, I started to read everything on the finance world, understanding what investment bank was doing, what a traditional bank, how the rating companies played, how the insurance played, how the central banks, the creation of money, so on and so forth\n",

      "Texto original:  So making a short story, long story shorter, so I ran my companies and I sold my last participation in Media Tech Company 2014 and I went about doing some of my name in New York for a year and a half, where I really, what I enjoy is supporting entrepreneurs, because the most difficult job in our economy is creating a company from scratch and you know probably what it is, because you're in that same situation and having there are first sales and make it sustainable in terms of viable. This is the most difficult job in the world. As I say, a lot to my clients, which are bankers, running a big bank, you could put a monkey running a big bank and it would still be profitable for five years. And that's the reality, because the critical mass is there, the structure is that. Yes, it requires skills, but really a talent and a rainmaker is needed when you create a company. So I did M&A and after that, we decided with my co-founder, Tima, we decided to create impact analytics, because we thought there was only one thing for me that had purpose is that we needed to contribute, even though it was a small drop in the ocean\n",

So I said, okay, what can we transform and what could we do to bring a sense and purpose to what's happening and participate in the more than needed transformation of our economies. So this is where we created impact. An impact mission, it's an impact driven company in a B-Core. In our mission, in our governance, also is based on that\n",

      "Texto original:  Each time we take a decision, we are looking at not only the financial aspect, but the impact mission we have. And if it doesn't achieve, and it doesn't seem to go in the direction or mission, we don't even look at the financial aspects, it's discarded. So this is the way I think that future companies should and must and will be managed, not only taking into account the financial performance, which is important in terms of sustainability, but primary, taking into account the negative and positive impact on society and on environment in order to sustain the real wealth that needs to be created. So when we identified that, I said, where can we play? And one thing that we've identified at that time is that there was a lack of genuine transparency. And at that time in 2017, 2018, the financial markets started to launch sustainable products, sustainable financial products with all these promises. But they were only grabbing the market and doing a lot of marketing with no fundamentals, no measurement, no verification of the facts they were selling to investors seeking purpose with their money\n",

      "Texto original:  And that was where it triggered and said, okay, that's the opportunity. The same way we had to standardize and put a lot of more rigor into the financial reporting in 1929 in United States when there was a big crisis, there was a law in 1933 saying that now and going forward, we need to have audited financial statements that are on the same standard and that are rigorous and you can be sued and put in prison if you play with it and mess around with this. The same thing is happening for impact assessments, which is what is the impact of a company on environment and on social and you need to have this standardized impact statements that will be used in the business process. And every single business process and the food chain of the financial institutions should it be lending, should it be investing. So my view is that we are today in a very, very exciting turning point where we're shifting from the financial economy towards an impact economy. And shifts takes about three, four, five, ten, sometimes ten years, but it's happening in COVID and this what we all lived on the planet for two years has accelerated this transformation\n",

      " Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of Doja Live. This Wednesday, January 11th, 2023. My name is Kim Lantis and joining me is co-host today is America Guerrero. Hello everybody. Hey Sam, how are you? Hey, hey America. And of course the guest of honor today, the most important person on today's show is Sam Fono Imoana, who is the founder and CEO of Data Join. Sam, thank you for being here. Hey thanks for having me on the show. This is my first live show so I'm really happy to be with you guys. Yeah, that's, you know, there's fun in the live show. I think it's just the unexpected can happen, right? So that's, that's perfect. And it's fun. We like to keep it conversational. We like to keep it real. And I think that's something that doesn't always happen in its, you know, produced. So it's part of our spirit here, but perfect. So today we're talking all about that behavior and that spirit with behavioral targeting, particularly for B2B business to business. But before we get into the specifics of the today's topic, we'd like to get to know you a bit more Sam if you could, what's your story? What's your passion and what's led up to Data Join? Right. So me, you know, Sam Fono Imoana, Kim, thanks. You're like one of the only, you know, interviewers that said my last name right. So that's awesome. We did not because we're connecting. Yeah. So I mean, that's a, that's a song one last name. I'm a pollination. I'm an island boy. That's, that's my background. I was born in Hawaii and, and then grew up in a lay after we, we moved from the island. So, but yeah, I mean, that's a little bit about myself. I mean, how did I get into tech? I don't know, it was a long road like partly, you know, by accident, but I think it was just all in the plan for Sam Fono Imoana. You know, I went to, I went to school at the BYU. I got my, my alma mater on today. I'm just here in Utah. This is, which is where I live now. And I was, I was studying business over there. But in the midst of learning about, you know, EBITDA and, and leadership classes for business. You know, I took a couple of information systems classes. And, you know, one of them was on Microsoft Excel. And the other one was, yeah, I mean, I didn't even know what a, what a spreadsheet was. I just remember taking that class. I'm like, what, what am I looking at here? Where are all these rectangles? And by the time I was done, I was like, whoa, I don't know how I can use this, but in the future, like, I think this is a powerful thing. And then, and then I took a second class on VBA, which is kind of the, you know, that's the coding language for Excel. And same type of thing, you know, in the midst of learning about debits and credits from my counting teacher, I tucked away, you know, this idea that, hey, I can code things and I can automate things. And, you know, years after I left those classes, you know, it came in handy, you know, for me later on down the road. So that's really the seeds were planted though back there in my college courses, I would say. Yeah. I think that's really beautiful. One of the things I was tell, I'm 40 now, I'm almost 41 in April, it's my birthday. But one of the things that I like to tell younger folks in particular those who are at the university level or just exiting university is the truth is you're, you're learning how to learn. And I think that's the key because we never actually stop learning and it's really interesting when you find those little nuggets of passion or interests along the way that who knows what it's going to turn into down the road, right. Yeah, exactly. I had no idea that, you know, if I was to see myself 15, 20 years from then, yeah, I wouldn't have imagined that I'd be here, but I would be happy, you know, to see that I landed here. I'm happy about that. So let's talk about data join your company that you've helped found and of course are leading today. What do you do and what problem are you solving? Yeah, so, you know, for me, my career, I always call myself a marketer's best friend. You know, I'm not a marketer, but I'm a marketer's best friend. And the reason why I say that is because, you know, all throughout my career, that's why I've helped. I've come in with these with these analysis skills, you know, I learned finance in my MBA program. And, you know, finance teaches you to follow the money and with that analysis skills and then those technical skills that I was talking about, you know, that I learned in college. And mostly outside of college actually just a lot of internet courses. I was able to go to marketers and you know, marketer spend so much money. They're one of the biggest expense centers for every company and you know, they they have a tough task of being able to prove their their value and what they're actually driving for the company. And so that's all I've done in my career is come in, I say, you know what you're spending money here, I'm going to connect it with the outcome with all of your sales, you know, whether that's, you know, inside of sales force, a different system or some sort of offline system. And that way you can go into the boardroom like with confidence and you can know that hey, I spend this much and it drove, you know, this much money. And here's all the, here's all the details for that. So data join is the evolution of that. It just helps marketers to be able to accomplish that accomplish that goal with that much easier. You know, they don't have to rely on an IT team as much, but they can really get the data that they need and all the systems that they use. And we're trying to make it easier than ever for marketers to do that. So they don't have to stand in line, you know, and wait for the IT team. That's great. Thank you. And I think we're going to deep dive into that right now with the topic of today's show America. What are we talking about today? Today we're going to talk about behavioral targeting for B2B. How can B2B marketers spam less on target more? Please share with us that secret. Yes, yes, yes. So I was, you know, I remember I was on another show a couple of months ago and the host he told me, hey, you know, I'm, I went to a website once and it was on accident. And I started seeing an ad for the shoes that was on that webpage and it followed me everywhere. And you know, you could tell he was a little bit angry. He had a, he had a East Coast accent. He's so off putting his whole putting. So he was, he was angry that he was getting targeted. And you know, he wasn't really interested at all like in buying those pair of shoes, right? And so, for me, you know, that's what I told them. I said, well, you know, they, they weren't really targeting you properly, right? Like if they would have seen that, you know, you actually came back to the site, maybe, and you added those shoes to your card. But you just didn't check out. Maybe you got distracted. Like if they saw all of that data, then then they should have, you know, probably sent to another ad for follow up. But if you just came once and never ever came back again, right? I mean, yeah. So, so that's, that's kind of the topic of the show. You know, today, like how can be to be marketers? How can they target based off of behavior? You know, true behavior instead of just, you know, targeting off of, you know, some higher level metrics or or piece of data that's, that's not really that relevant. It doesn't show true intent like titles. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I think today marketers get confused. Like, hey, you know what? I bought this list. I bought this email list of, you know, it has 100 CMOs and that's our target audience. Well, guess what? Like those are not qualified by by any means. Like doesn't mean that none of them are even interested in your product. So, exactly. And I think it's really interesting, focusing on less spam because the truth is spam doesn't help anyone, right? It's not helping the marketer. And it's certainly not helping, hoping the receiver, right? So, particularly your example of someone who's not even interested, right? I don't like these shoes and ever meant to wind up there. And I think what you were just laying out in that example answered a lot of my questions when you were introducing data join at the beginning of the show sort of this chicken. I want to say the chicken in the egg kind of process, right? And it was interesting to me that you were talking about the outcome, right? Of being able to provide marketers with what was successful. And to me, I was like, seems interesting because what my logic was telling me or what I think maybe incorrectly, right? And the marketer myself was like, we're starting. This seems to me like a starting in the wrong place, right? Because the why would I start at the end when not the beginning? But then it makes a lot of sense because when we're able to see what's successful at the end, that's what then can become iterative and then what we can repeat and have better success right from the start. Am I on the right track there? Yeah, no, I think that's really it because there's a lot of dead ends, right? And it's nice to know that, but really what we want to know is what worked, you know, like what got us to drive this new opportunity that's in pipeline or a big deal that we closed with IBM, right? Like what were actually all the marketing efforts and touch points that it took to get them there. Yeah, that's what we want to know. So it's a little counterintuitive, but we want to start with the end in mind, you know, as they say. When it comes to behavioral targeting, then what I mean, America mentioned titles, like, you know, these potential key personas and CMO or whatever it might be, but what are these behavioral components when we're talking about behavior, what are we targeting, what are you able to look at or what do you suggest that marketers actually be paying attention here? Yeah, no, that's a great question. I think for B2B marketers, you know, we don't we don't know everything. We don't have all the data like we don't know conversations that that someone may have with their boss, right? We're not privy to that type of data. So the best that we have to go off really is, you know, what happens on their website, like that's that's like for us at data joint, that's the best behavioral data that B2B companies are sitting on. Like, what are people doing on your website? And, you know, who are they, right? So that that's the type of behavioral triggers. Like did they engage with the with my chat with with my chatbot, you know, did they come in and watch every video to completion on this new product that we just released last quarter? You know, did they download every piece of content? You know, did they even stay for more than 10 minutes? So these are the type of events. It kind of sounds like common sense and it is. But yeah, I mean, someone who's spending that much time on your website, you know, versus someone who just came and bounced after one second, like who would you rather spend more time with if you're a sales rep or you're a marketer, right? You would definitely rather spend time with the one who's showing like more interest. And so for us is all about the website behavior. That's that's the king of behavioral data as far as data, you know, first party data that companies own. So it makes a lot of sense. And from there, you're able to work backwards. Like if you find these strong behavioral, you know, tendencies, can you tell they came from this place or this ad or it was just a fluke. Like, is that where you start working backward also? Yeah, definitely. I mean, that's one thing that we do even just here at Data Joined. We're looking for the high intent people on our website. And then we're looking to see like, you know, what ad campaigns, you know, what specific ads drove them to the side. Because we want to know, hey, which message was resonating with them at the very top of the funnel and found like these high intent people that are kind of researching out everything. So yeah, we definitely work backwards. And I think more importantly, just because in today's, today's recession environment and uncertainty. Everyone's, you know, everyone's trying to make more with less. And so it's not just important to know where they came from, but it's really important. Like if you could just identify who they are. Like if you could just identify them, then then you'll know like who to prioritize your marketing efforts towards, right? Like I don't need a, you know, spam and, you know, kind of give my brand a bad reputation to these people over here. They're not interested, but these, you know, these 100 people are very interested. I should really focus all my time and attention and love whatever right with those guys, right? Because they're the ones who are showing interest in us. So it makes a lot of sense. I'm curious is, and I know I think the focus here is on the marketer. We've mentioned that a lot. But how could, you know, tools like yours, I data join, how have you seen this play out in the dynamics between them, the marketing team and the sales team? Because in terms of marketing, like, okay, I'm going to, you know, push now and add to this person that was on the site into their LinkedIn account or whatever it might be. But then also alerting the sales team like guys, this is a big fish. Like you should go after him. Like are you able to see this like increased communication and optimization in terms of like a handoff as well or what are some of the dynamics that you've seen play out? Yeah, no, that's, you know, for me, that's really the goal. I was listening to Forrester. They did a live show just right before the break or during the holiday. And they were talking about this like sales and marketing alignment. That's one of the big priorities, you know, for 2023. You know, when I think there's some sort of stat that like 78% of companies, you know, they report that their sales and marketing teams are not aligned. These are B2B companies. And that's costing them like 10% of their revenue because because they're not sharing the data, you know, back and forth. Like they're just losing out on deals because, you know, prospects were ready to go, you know, they don't get touched and they just go somewhere else where they where they can find the answer to some competitor. So because I think there's this tendency to wait like unless the prospect filled out a contact me form. People aren't doing anything, right? Or it's not getting to the sales team per se. Yeah, I mean, it definitely yes. For sure, the way that I set up today, if you fill out a form, then you get put into the sale into sales force. You know, sometimes they go to market offers get qualified and then get moved to sales force. But the idea is that, hey, you know, that's, that's not the finish line, right? That person's going to keep going back to the website. I think people in general, they would rather just do the research on their own rather than jump on a phone conversation with the sales rep. So you have to keep monitoring them even after they fill out the form. You gotta say, hey, like these guys are still going back. They're eating up all of this content on the site. And if the sales team can have that data and they can get triggered to it, then like that big fish. I said, hey, this is a big fish. They're showing a lot of intent. You know, you have 100 leads right now on your list of prospects. Forget the other 99. Just just go to this big, this big fish that's showing a lot of intent. And you know, even specifically what they're, what they're researching. So you can go on there informed and, you know, try to help them solve their problem that they're interested in in your company for. Yeah, I think that's a really big clue to like in terms of what content are they consuming if it's, you know, a certain blog post of a certain theme or whatever it might be, then that salesperson can come in informed. Even asking the right questions in the right way that can spark the right type of conversation. Absolutely. Absolutely. That's what we're doing. Like we eat our own dog food here at DataJoin and that's what we do. That's how we find our best prospects. Right. We're watching who's. I love that analogy. And it's strangely a lot of businesses don't actually utilize their own business. Right. And it's great for it's a here that you are doing that America. What were you going to tell us? I'm thinking of those salespeople who are in this battle of that the sales is a number game. And the other side of this battle are the people who said that the more personalization the better, right. How do you convince these people who are just attached to this idea that okay, why do I need this whole information to personalize emulsify? If I'm going to take like it is going to take me three hours for me to send the emails. How do you convince them? Or what are the values that? Yeah, I think that's a good question. Those who are just, you know, they're just trying to hit their numbers and their quarter. They're not so concerned. I think that's I think that's changing, you know, every every month, every quarter as we keep heading into this recession. I mean, we see all of the layoffs in tech. So I think just, you know, I think it's evolving that way where we have to do good marketing like we can't just hit numbers. But you really have to have to be smart and find those who are truly interested as fast as possible. Because that's the only way that you're going to hit your numbers, right. I think that tech in general has been kind of funded by the by the VCs and private equity to kind of pay these these paychecks. And, you know, those times are over like you actually have to you actually have to solve real problems. You know, for real people and create real revenue. If you want your company to continue on. And so, you know, I think that I think that that mindset is changing America. I had a call with the large Fortune 500 company just this week. And they're all they're all about it. They're like, yeah, our sales team like we're looking for higher quality leads. You know, we want this stream of high quality leads. And there's so many people that are abandoning their orders on our website. But we don't know who they are in Salesforce. Because that data lives in inside of Adobe analytics. You know, it lives in a different system. And so they come to us to say if you can get us all that's all those signals, then then our sales reps will know, hey, go to these guys so that we can actually hit our numbers this quarter. So I think the mindset is changing just just because of our tough times that we're going through. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense talking about tough times and my question is, what's the difference? Let's say between a platform, right? Yours that join in something like Google analytics, you know, like this big dog these let's say free ish versions that people can use. What's the drive? Like what's the difference in terms of the ability to personalize or to target even better, especially when we're talking about recession. Why? Why is this an investment worth making? So the way I like to think of data join is, you know, it's not another tool like it actually is not a, you know, a web analytics tool or another tool to add on your already bloated stack right everyone stack is full of, you know, this is got more tools than Home Depot. That's, it's funny, but it's for real. So, you know, for us, like we're not, we're not another tool. We don't compete with any of those. All we do is take your stack and we connect all of the systems together. So fine, if you're using Google analytics, that's perfect. And we're going to take all of that rich data out of Google analytics and we're going to pump it into Salesforce or your sales reps can see everything happening on the website as well. Or, you know, we're going to take your Salesforce data, you know, your job titles and your, your opportunity stages, we're going to feed that back in the Google analytics so that you can do better, you know, better A B testing and personalization on the website. So, so we're not another tool for the stack. We're just like a glue for your entire stack where you can just glue together all of the first party customer data across platforms. Makes a lot of sense. In terms of tooling and the design of your own platform, I'm guessing this is working through like APIs and things, right? Like, how are you, I think two major, let's say concerns or problems, one time mind, there's one, the security, because a lot of times people hold these things really close and they're like, we don't just want somebody, you know, APIs coming in out and things. And then also the usability because marketers and sales people, you know, may or may not have a more technical background. And so we want it to the ease of use, I think is something that's extremely important here. How are you going to about solving both of those things in terms of security and usability? Yeah, you know, that that's a great question. You know, for most of our customers, they're all enterprise companies because Adobe is our big partner. So, basically Adobe's customers are our customers, right? Thanks. And, yes, I've been through, you know, so many security reviews with teams, you know, large financial institutions. So we take data privacy, you know, very seriously here at Data Join. And, you know, what we do is that we make sure that we don't store anything with our integrations. It's built on top of the APIs like you mentioned, Kim. So we've, you know, all those APIs are all, you know, HTTPS. Everything is encrypted, you know, well in transit. Everything is encrypted while it's being processed, you know, on our servers as it's passing through to the other system. So we definitely take privacy seriously. And one other thing that we do, we don't pass any PII data, you know, per se. So we'll never, ever pass like like an email address or any type of financial information. We basically just pass anonymous data from system to system. And, you know, we don't hold anything like on our servers at all. So that's, that's how we kind of address the security piece. Yeah, I mean, we've been through, you know, we have a large, large data security company is one of our customers. And so, man, I felt like I had to go to trial for those guys and just kind of to show them what we're doing. But we take it very seriously. And then you're, your second question about making it usable for marketers. Yeah, I mean, that's the whole goal for for data join is that a marketer can can use it like they can come in. Now, you may need someone who uses the one system and then some, so for example, someone who who uses Google ads and they want to integrate that data with with their with your Adobe analytics. You may need the Adobe person and the Google ads person sitting down going through it. But the idea is that, yeah, they can sit down and they can just map. Hey, I want to push this segment from Adobe into Google ads. And the interface is really nice. I mean, it's, it's built very friendly. And we try to have as many descriptions in there as possible. And even even tutorial videos that's coming through on our product broke map as well. But that's the goal we want to make it so they don't have to go to it. I have a growth code component is or is coming up. Yeah, right now it's it's no code our product. So it's just is literally drag and drop. And that's it. So there are other systems, you know, that I've used that are integration tools. And I'm a data person. Yeah, it's not very fun to use, you know, I've used I won't say like the name of it. It's a well known product that a lot of people use. But I mean, it's it's it's a it's not fun to use. And you know, I'd rather write just pure Python rather than use that tool, right. And so I'm trying to make it without in mind and being a marketer's best friend, we try to make this very easy for marketers. So. Very cool. Okay. I have a question. Maybe it's a dumb one, but I would ask anyway. I have seen in websites. No, the question is what are the weird trendings that you have seen in websites directly info. And the reason why I'm asking for example, I have there were three times that I try to connect with someone in them in companies that are in the metaverse industry and their websites are kind of different. So I need to go to LinkedIn to check what they are doing so I can recollect more values and ask them to be a guest in our show. So do you know if they're like weird trendings and now with the technology industry are changing in their websites. Yeah, in terms of. Yeah, I'm not really sure I know that we do, you know, we do quite a bit on LinkedIn. It seems like LinkedIn is fresher like we can we can post, you know, more frequent updates there. I can post every day. And so I find a lot of people I find a lot of my personal communication, you know, is with is with people I find on LinkedIn versus the website. But I'm not sure if that's answering your question for our website. I mean, we just try to have a clear CTA and an easy to fill out form. But yeah, we're not doing anything else really to try to collect any other any other data other than the form like that's what we use so. Perfect. Did I answer your question? I hope I answered your question. Yes, I just I was thinking of, for example, that website in this they are in the metaverse and everything and you go and there is like no information. They're just like images moving and then you need to have that kind of data that is kind of confusing. If I want to add value to my emails and invite them to be a guest, that's why I asked. Yeah, I think it comes into this idea of garbage and garbage out right and I think even with that data join my habits limitations. If what you're getting if your website or things are not up to part is confusing, it's not going to help anyone right. Yeah, if you just had like one page and just some images then there's not really a there's not that many data points necessarily to work with so I agree with that. All right, well, we're here to the final minutes of our show already if you can believe it or not. Sam, I wanted to bring it back to you as a founder as well as data join and the company and the culture that you're building. What have you found that works has worked really, really well for you and you know as a leader and as a company and what are some things that maybe you would advise others not to do based off of your own experience and learning. Yeah, no, that's a great that's a great question. I mean, for our core values. So our first two are very important, but they're very they're a little bit contrasting. So our first core value is a lot of right. I mean, we're from the islands and it's this idea that we back each other up. We show a lot of care for for one another and respect. And that's just important like culturally, you know, that's that's our personal backgrounds, right. A lot of us at my company are from are from the islands and so. But the second core value is is just as important, you know, possibly even more important and that's find a way right we always find a way. You know, grit, that's probably a good word to describe it, but you know in these startup atmospheres like that's we also need that just as much. I mean this morning on our company meeting that was that was what we shared this morning on our company meeting is that grit is. Grit is a great prevails whenever you get knocked down and you stand back up, grit prevails, but if you do not stand back up, then grit, grit fails right. That's that's the type of company culture that that we're building here in data join. I think that's my own personal style. I'm a I'm a easygoing guy. You know, I always have my my you care my desk. I can just relax. I also, but but I work hard and we we try to bust through problems. I mean, it doesn't matter if it's a hundred foot wall like we will find a way through it too. So that's that's kind of the contrast of our culture, but that that is our culture is the two sides of that coin. I love it is a loha one of those words that works as both a greeting and as a goodbye. It does. Yeah, like, and I think that's beautiful because I think if that's representing you as a culture, it's really about the journey to right. It's not it's the you're welcome here and also seeing people off at the end is a really important piece. I think of a company culture that the entire beginning to end is a good thing for company and for person. I love it. Yeah, I think you know, when you go to Hawaii, when you get there, people will greet you with a loha. And then when you leave, you know, when we left to move back here, they seem that song, a loha away to wish us was as we leave. But yeah, I like what you said. I mean, it's the full journey like we care about. You know, our people trying to develop them, you know, and have that growth because that's where they're going to find success personally and in their careers. So. Thank you. Thank you so much. Sam for joining us today on Doja Live. We wish you as well as dad join nothing more than success and your continued journey this 2023 and beyond. Hey, thank you so much. Came in America. It's been my pleasure to be on with you guys this morning. So thank you. Thank you. Stick around for just a minute, as we go off air. But before we do go off air, we like to talk about what we're going to be doing the rest of this week. Yes. Tomorrow we're going to have another show with Paul Alard, who found their and CEO of the company impact. The topic is going to be about AI and non financial reporting, exploring the limits. And then on Wednesday, we're going to have our second episode of the. Friday. What did I say? Okay. Friday. Yeah. And the topic is going to be about finances inside and outside the metaverse that two shows are going to be yet in a.m. Pacific. That's right. So catch us tomorrow right here on Doja Live. And until then stay safe. Everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n"

      " Good morning everyone and welcome to Dojo Live. My name is Kim Lantis and it's my pleasure to be here moderating what is the part 2 or 4 part series all about the metaverse every Friday for the month of January. Joining me today are the same two of the same individuals that we had last week. We've got D&L Agamboa who is a UX designer as well as for Mean Chavez and experienced researcher both with Encore and today's special guest is Nippur Avantika, VP of Digital Learning at Encore India. Hello everyone. Hi, good morning. Good morning. And thank you to your audience right for joining us a bit earlier today than usual. We were able to accommodate Nippur who's just wrapping up her day as we're getting ours started. Now Nippur before we get started into today's topic about the metaverse all about finances inside and outside. Let's get to know you just a bit better. Please, what's your story, your passion and what's led up to your time focused on digital learning? Sure, Kim. So, hi everyone. I'm Nippur. I had the Digital Learning Vertical for Encore in Pune India. I have been in this technology enable learning field for over two decades. I started my career as a learning designer, instructor of the instructional designer, then moved on to learning consulting. I've consulted with like a whole lot of large enterprises across geographies like US, Europe, A-PAC everywhere. And then about five years back, I shifted my gears to the business side of things and moved into operations. So it was a whole lot of exciting journey. But that little teeny tiny geek in me who is like, so I kind of, I'm not going to kind of keep my ears open for what's happening in this field. And I'm very passionate about learning design, about user experience, about making that impact on the performance of employees through these programs. And the other aspect is I think this whole metaverse, I think it has its origin in the training and the learning field because immersive technology, simulations, digital twinning, these are the concepts which have been there in learning and training industry for over more than a decade or even older. So that's where the my whole thing of getting a little inquisitive about what this metaverse is there. Yeah. I think that makes a really great point. And first I'd like to say, let's all embrace our inner geek. I think it's a great place to live and enjoy life. Cool. Last week was the first show of this four part series and that was really about the metaverse basics. So we tweaked a little bit here in what virtual reality is, augmented reality is what the metaverse is, touched on maybe some ethical components of what that might imply. And my takeaway was this idea. I think it was for me who said, we think of the metaverse as this internet that we get to walk around in. In some ways it is that but it can be so much more I think what you all ordered to just now and for it as well as I think Sandra last week's one of last week's participants mentioned. She heard this definition of like an internet that you get to experience. You're experiencing it. And I think Deneal's take was that we, it's a virtual right, a digital representation of ourselves rather than just a profile right with it's something that has a lot more dimension to it. And as we kick off then into the metaverse, I think we're talking today the focus is, you know, finances inside and outside and taking a look at virtual money and real money right and how they might be used in the metaverse and what that means for brands, for funding, for market share. So it's really good to have you here in a poor way. I think you're your business background. So I think the biggest question then is we're talking about this, this internet that we get to experience that we get to walk around in. My first question is who's behind it right? Who are these companies or the individuals who are the major players who's creating this metaverse or I think it's Deneal's last week. It's not just one right we can have multiple metaverses. But who are the big players here? Okay, so if you like, I would like to start sorry. Okay, so who builds it and who owns it, I think it will determine what it is right. But I think to answer this question, you need to understand that it's not one. Like you were just saying it's just not one metaverse. I think we are using that word freely. It's just and some people say that it's just marketing like the metaverse and that's not the metaverse. These are the metaverses, these are a lot of places, a lot of people. I think true meta made this research of course, it tried the XR technologies, but it is not just the meta that's built in this. It's everyone and I think we have very big examples with Roblox and Minecraft. They already have metaverses. They already have its own metaverses every user can build its own metaverse and the idea is that we as a community will be part of that too. It's not like who owns the metaverse, we could also own a metaverse. Okay. So it did get some of those big players mentioned Roblox and Minecraft. Lupur, go ahead. Yeah, so I conquer with Anela, I think it's not just one person or one organization which is owning the metaverse. Right now what we have is multiple and what is the term which has been used right now is proto metaverse and it is essentially coming from the gaming industry. So we have platforms like sandbox, upland, Roblox, exit infinity, these kind of platforms which started the concept and it's still from the gaming side. And of course we have now Facebook which renamed itself as meta in 2021. That's when this whole buzz around metaverse came into and then we have Microsoft with its mesh platform. So there are multiple platforms but the essence of metaverse is that it should be driven and owned by the users, by the players and that is the whole idea behind it. So yeah, that's what it is. Yeah, I think it's well as a market, it's a still growing one like a, a right that is value that 60 trivial years last year. We're used to starting in 2020 so we'll see but it's expected to grow like 10 fold within the decade and I think that's very interesting. Like in the pool in LA, I already mentioned some of the players and they are not a lot of them still like it's a relatively short list like meta, transcend, and media, Roblox. It's interesting that we all think of Roblox and the question whether Roblox is or isn't a metaverse is an open one and it depends a lot on what your definition of a metaverse is. Even the CEO is like sort of vague about it. And I think that's very interesting because it shows that we haven't still come to an agreed upon definition and that will be a community for like the person like we have problem metaverses. As for the users, we should be in control. If we consider that Roblox is a metaverse, then the users are very, very young because Roblox is all about them kids. If we include like Roblox users, the majority of metaverse users will be below 18 years old and I think that's highly interesting. I don't think we've ever had like a public popular technology that is as dominated by the zombie for last is one. Wow. I think that's a really interesting take too and going back a little bit to last week's conversation, the ethics behind it. If the main user base is so young, what does that mean for the current adults presumably who are mostly behind the current creative force and then for the upcoming generations and taking that over? I think it makes, it's still up and coming, it's still not that big. What is this cost and is it worth it? I think last week we mentioned that, I think it was Sandra who mentioned, she's really into this because it seems like the next thing right, we're at this cost. What does that imply in terms of cost, worth value? I think you mentioned cost and I'm like operational cost and that's like what is needed to keep it running, like hardware, servers, energy electricity, we mentioned like the sustainability of it all because it takes a lot of energy to keep it running and you pull all of that together and it's very, very hard to give you a number. I have no idea. There are some studies like this is how much energy you spend sending an email and those kinds of things are becoming harder and harder to measure. But I think that ultimately the question about cost is not really one that needs an exact answer but like it's a question about whether we think it is worth it, as you mentioned, it's one about value and I don't think we often have the space to ponder the merits of our new technology before we put it out there. That's usually how it works. First it appears and then we will ponder about it. I think that's something that we as a society maybe should change, I don't know. But the only way forward is I can't give you an answer on worth or value. I used to think that it wasn't worth it and then I wouldn't want to engage with it. I don't want it. I'm going to pretend that it doesn't exist. But I think that's the opinion that's sort of the one we need at the table. If we ever want to change the world into one that discusses some ponder the merits of technology before it's out there, we need to involve those kinds of opinions. I think that's my takeaway. Is it worth it? I don't know. But whatever we think we should discuss it. That's an interesting question. I think particularly is you all as researchers, as designers, why don't people want it or why do they? There's probably equal value in the why-naughts versus the why-yes. It's extremely interesting. How about making money? As it stands, we have this idea of virtual money and real money. What's this dynamic currently looking like in the metaverse and what might it look like in the future? What's the expectation? So I think metaverse is offering new ways of making money. It's kind of letting people, it may lead to change of business models for companies, for brands, even for users at an individual level. Because as I look at it, we are already leading two lives, all of us because of what has happened in the internet in the last decade and the whole pervasiveness of social media and every aspect of our lives. All of us already have a virtual digital presence footprint, both as individuals socially and professionally. We are all there. Now with metaverse, it gives us an opportunity as it's saying the word is experience. Right now, we are into dimension. The interactions are virtualized in asynchronous with metaverse, it becomes more synchronous. We are right there. We interact with each other. And I was just thinking like, you know, the way the events have happened in the last three years with the pandemic coming in, the shift in how, you know, the whole workplace trend has changed. This whole hybrid distributed working. So are these things all interconnected and then this whole buzz around metaverse now? So is it like some kind of, I don't know, sequence of events which is leading to like a major paradigm shift in how, you know, the humans will go about their business, whether it is, you know, socializing, communication, relationships, whatever it is, that is what I was just thinking yesterday, like, that shift which is happening. So that's what I think that metaverse will, you know, bring in very different ways of how we go about our business, how we generate money, how we interact, you know, everything is going to shift. And it will happen very, it will not be like one fine day we are all doing crypto or we are buying an FTE. It is not going to happen like that. It is just like small changes which we will not even realize. The way we adapted to the whole mobile technology and went like everybody's in their smartphones all 24-7. It is just going to be that shift which would be so gradual and subtle that we will not notice. Yeah, it is wild. Like, it is weird for me when you have these moments of nostalgia, like talking about that gradual shift. I was born in 1982. I am 40, you know, the boom of the internet in the late 90s when it became more common place. Like, I can remember all of this. And I am looking back at my life and like, I can remember like having these big maps in the car and like trying to unfold it and figure out where we are going. The worst part was trying to fold the map back up, right? That is an impossible task. And then it shifted to map quest and I remember going and like printing off these directions of where I wanted to go. And now it is just like Google, where do I go? I am going to use something to do. We have even used an action set. But the weird thing is it makes that memory of what things used to be like a blur. Like it never was once that way, right? I can use the rotary phones. I used to have like a whole list of telephone numbers memorized. Now I think I have maybe two or three memorized and the rest is just calling. And it is wild, but you are absolutely right. I think it is that analogy. What is it? Like if you were to drop a frog and a pot of boiling water, he is going to jump out, right? Supposedly urban legend. I have never tried this to kill a frog. But if you put him in the cool water and you gradually bring it up to a boil, supposedly he won't move, right? And I think that is a really good analogy for what you are talking about in the pool. Don't boil frogs, you guys. Don't boil frogs. Don't you like this? Not support animal cruelty. Yeah, yeah. I think it is very interesting what you mentioned. Because we tend not to remember the crazy things that used to be out there and never to crude in our world. Like we think of the past as like a discontinuous series of efforts that I will let here. But in the process there was a lot of wild things that never really become popular or anything like every time there is a new technology, like there is a fever to put it everywhere. And you have like your twilling from your fridge and wondering why do I want to do that? But then as time moves forward, it's a little sound and you get something different that you didn't expect before and you tend to remember it. It was like, oh yeah, this was always the path. It all seemed to lead here, but it was not like that. And it makes me think it was wild right now, like my daughter every now and then I do limit this. She's only 11. She likes row blocks. And every now and then mom, can I get some row blocks mom? And so I'm pumping like real money into this universe so that she can buy something necessarily as or what I think is silly, right? So her avatar can walk around with a panda, your headband or something. I don't know whatever is important. And it leads to this idea of how the metaverse could potentially be used to generate real money. I mean, you can be in and you can make commerce and make fake money, I think, that you can exchange for other things within this virtual community. But then there's this component of real money too. It reminds me of a past show, this is back in June actually with Anne Hand. She's a CEO of Super League Gaming and they focus on brand extensibility within the metaverse and how big players are getting involved. I think Nike and Coca-Cola. But this idea of having this exclusive Nike tennis shoe that's only available, right? But then I'll be able to extract that into the real world and even test marketing, right? Okay, if this style of shoe is amazing in the metaverse, why don't we make it in the real world too? Actually, it's a crossover. Yeah, sorry, Kim. Actually, it's very interesting that you mentioned that because I think the question will be, do you want it in the real world? Could you be for it in the real world? That's a big question actually. Actually, I still like to talk about it like digital designers started with creating clothes in the real world and she didn't even sell those. So she started creating clothes for the virtual world and she was like, hidden up and everyone wanted their clothes, sorry. So the work question was that people didn't want those same clothes in the real world. They wanted them in the digital world and they wanted like, for their arbiters and for their, I don't know, profile pictures. And actually, it cheap went that big that I think Gucci, like box some of their clothes and made like a XR filter where you can like try it on in your real world, but it's not a real thing. So it's like this whole weird stuff and big players come around like Gucci, like Nike, like playing with these geeks. Let's say call it that. Like these geeks have said, hey, I'm not selling my stuff here. I'm not selling it there. I am already there. I already play there. So I want my clothes there. So and I think that's a fair point. I don't remember which dojo live guest it was. It wasn't Ann. It was someone else and we were talking about the the metaverse, but his point was why can't the metaverse be what we wanted to be like in the metaverse, everyone should have a house, right, which isn't necessarily the case in the real world or to your point we threw Gucci out there. I certainly can't afford a Gucci keychain much less anything else that they create, right? But in the metaverse, why not? It's this amazing opportunity to have and create whatever we'd like. And then it goes back to I think our first show, the ethics behind this, right? Of what should that look like? What should that feel like? How should we be experiencing it? I was just thinking about it when number was coming into it because I think she's still all right because I think the ethics, some of the stuff that we already seen the internet sadly will move to this new universe. But what about these business models that you can replay that on this new world? We'll need new business models, new ways to make money, new ways to decentralize this money to just want owner to just want big players. So I think that's the most interesting part of this new world, new metaverse and how are we going to make many, how are we going to make the artist, the owner of their art. And all these NFTs, I think we haven't touched that yet. But NFTs, let's touch on it. Yeah, I have a question. What does ownership look like in the metaverse? Can you really own anything there? So NFT means non-fungible token. What's non-fungible? Well, what's fungible? Fungible is like $1 for $1. I'm going to give you the same, it's the same. But non-fungible, that means that I cannot give you the same. So if I'm giving you, I don't know, marker, I can give you a mark because that's non-fungible. That's not the same. I can give you other stuff for your stuff. So if I create this, I can't sell it for whatever I want because it's non-fungible. So going back to the old days, the system was trading. That's the trade. That's the trade. So I can trade it for whatever I want. And that means that I can sell it for a lot of money or like a zero. And that goes to the assets in digital world. Like, okay, how are we going to play this game? How are we going to create this NFTs with this technology, like the blockchain technology that means that you can trace the very first creation of this because the creator took this instead of take this and make it digital and it will charge you a little commission. But that means that these go to the virtual world and that you can sell it. So anyone can do it. Anyone? So, which is kind of refreshing when you think about it that way. I mean, maybe we're, I think today in 2023, we're so far removed from what used to be a very natural thing amongst people, right? Like I grow grain, you grow corn. I'll give you some grain for some of your corn, right? And depending on how long you maybe you have to invest in corn or how long it takes to grow versus wheat, what do I know? But maybe, okay, I need a little bit more of your wheat in order for me to give you some of this corn. But I think there's something refreshing about this, right? That we don't have this weird money component in the middle that just makes things strange. Like it's such a strange concept really with money. So is there something into that in the metaverse? Like why is this appealing to us and why is it working now? Yeah, go ahead, go ahead for me. Thank you. Yeah, I'm fascinated by what ownership means in the metaverse. And digital ownership is in a way challenging our notions about ownership. I think that's very interesting. Like NFTs are this very popular buzzword because they are one of the proposed solutions, like how do we deal with digital ownership? How do you own anything digital? The thing is like it's such a popular word, it's become abuse in a way like there's a lot of scams, there's grifters in the space. But the thing is like at the end of the day, an NFTs, like as an L I was saying, it's a token. It's non-fungible is you can't interchange it. It points to allocation, usually within the open internet. And it's available on a public ledger. Like everyone can see who is associated with it. That's what it is. It's not more or less. But that can be used in many, many interesting ways. And some companies are already exploring that and I think that's a cool notion. Like again, I think once the dust settles around the metavers we will have something very cool. But in a way we sort of have to build in the dust. But I think the legal framework may be more complicated but we're working on it because we know the implications around that. There's NFTs we came up with with AI generated art. Monkeys here. And there's a lot of things to discuss. For example, did you know that you can't really copyright AI generated art? That's an issue because then you can really sell its ownership, at least in the real world. But that's like a whole complicated discussion and I guess my takeaway is like, yeah, it's a very cool space to rethink ownership. We have the technology to do cool things with it. And what we need to do is like agree or maybe just discuss what we want to do. Yeah. So I think if we keep the legal aspect and there's a whole lot as for me, saying that's a different discussion altogether ethics and legal aspect of NFTs of these currencies of assets and the metavers. But NFT per se, I think it's kind of a unique asset which can lead to a lot of brands and companies are leveraging it for developing their relationship with the customers for giving them rights in their own business. So if I own a certain NFT, I have a right to say comment on their product design or to kind of ask for something or to live an experience outside the in real world. So those are the things which are new, which were not there earlier. And NFT also kind of from if we look at it generally from the creative community perspective, it is removing that middle layer which used to control these assets, right? So I as an artist can directly create an NFT, whether it is a music album or a little video clip or an art. And I can mint it and then I can put it out there and I still can sell it directly. But you can have access to it directly. And so that is at an individual level. And then I still keep getting the commission as the NFT moves in this metavers space. That's the thing. That's a blockchain. I learned that. Yes. And through the secondary markets and all that. So I keep getting my commission even though I have sold it. And there is no middle layer in between to whom I'm paying any amount or you know controlling my creativity and telling me you have to do it like this only and then only I can say they put it in a specific museum just just an example. So that freedom. So the idea is that how much of it is getting implemented right now is you know it's a whole question and discussion separately but that's one aspect of NFTs. A lot of brands are using NFTs for creating that customer experience for asking their users to be part of you know decision making process about their products and services, getting that feedback. So in that sense I think NFTs are unique concept and it is here to stay I feel. Yeah. Yeah I think that's a good point. And I think this question I mean is ludicrous isn't might seem to me for your woman against you know with my 11 year old daughter of like okay we're spending real money on this. You sure you know that hairstyle and Roblox okay it's your money you know that's where you want to what it's built. So this question of will users want to spend money in the universe I think we've already learned this as a resounding yes right. And a big yes but the question is what does this mean maybe for the real world economy. I know this is a big question is we're coming to the final minutes of our show today and we've got you know just what recently has recently unfolding and happening you know with FTX and we've got Bitcoin and Sam Bankman is it fried freed I'm not even sure how to pronounce this last name but I think there was this boom and now people have kind of come back and like oh boy like this can be bad too the dust settling I think is for me has alluded to earlier but what does this mean or what can this mean for the real world economy as we keep pushing forward. I love this question because I'm a UX so like you're saying like why does people will spend money in the universe but then this takes me to the real question like is this people is this users or are they customers like no they are users so in these metaphors you need to give them value first and then after the value that you gave them they will decide if they purchase or not so then you need to think first of the value that you are giving them instead of what they are giving you I heard this phrase and I love it and I am going to read it as says we must focus on taking care of our communities instead of taking from them and that's big because in this metaphors I think that will need to be the point of view of everyone because the metaverse economy should not mirror what is happening right now in the real world because we can't change it because we can't put the user first the user can have value first and then give you money but that's putting them in the center like designing for them and in any metaphors and giving them the tools to build their own world to be their own selves like you were saying I want to pay money because I want to I don't know it tries like a fairy because I feel like a fairy so I love you know like in the new way of being in the digital world I can do that and I can decide to do that and spend money in that so I think as long as we are juicers I think that will be an amazing world. And I'm just like seeing the positive aspect of if you consume more and more of virtual goods we are putting less burden on earth in terms of generating trash like that's just one of the good aspects of it like if we are happy with virtual objects and you know we spend more and more in that aspect then of course we are you know kind of leveraging or using less of our three sources which are right now like a huge like this whole climate I think that's a fair point. A really good point because I guess you're right I would much rather buy my daughter panda me as I'm not a zero footprint I try my best to you know do that as much as I can increasingly but yeah you're right like I feel more comfortable allowing my dad or my daughter to have panda ears inside Roblox than I think I would you know in the real world. Yeah not because it's not fun or whatever but like this you know this yeah just this sustainability of it and then later on you're like what do I do with these panda ears where do I put them they're quittering up my house or whatever I think it's a really really fair point and I think it brings some deep insight into what the future or the new economy might look like and how it doesn't have to break us it can actually help us and also I think be a testing space perhaps for how we can pull some of that out into the real world and and putting the user first which I think is really interesting and it makes me think of the field of dreams the 80s movie right if you build it they will come and it's a really fair point which we don't usually do in the real world right. Well at least your daughter what they're like ears like my little cousin wanted a donkey and they might be doing stuff with that. I got it for her and now they have an adult donkey to deal with and that's like a real world donkey. Yeah well okay we do not boil frogs but we do buy donkeys. We have to now be coming and I'm dead your species. If we couldn't get any more stereotypical Mexican this was good. And I think this is this last don't you live show when I was coming was it last week we were having a party downstairs when I went out air and there were literal like mariachi music in the background and I'm like okay so we got the mariachi's now we've got the donkeys what's next. Mexico we love it we love it so I love it it's absolutely beautiful very good. Well thank you so much for being a dinner for for joining me today as we keep deep diving into the metaverse or now as we know metaverse is join us next Friday for part three of the series and that one's going to be all about I think right up the first alley as well right the digital learning component is that what it is. Now actually next one is all about pop culture. We're always like we're always mentioning movies and references and our ideas have very much been influenced by the media we consume and we thought it nice to discuss that media. Now be great so join us and then next week's pop culture and the final show is all about the digital learning experience perfect. Well thank you again everyone and I would like to remind our viewers to join us on Monday as we have our regular recap show at Ten of Rock talking about all three shows this week and introducing next week's shows as well and until then have a great weekend and stay safe.

You know, when I think there's some sort of stat that like 78% of companies, you know, they report that their sales and marketing teams are not aligned. These are B2B companies. And that's costing them like 10% of their revenue because because they're not sharing the data, you know, back and forth. Like they're just losing out on deals because, you know, prospects were ready to go, you know, they don't get touched and they just go somewhere else where they where they can find the answer to some competitor.

So you have to keep monitoring them even after they fill out the form. You gotta say, hey, like these guys are still going back. They're eating up all of this content on the site.
